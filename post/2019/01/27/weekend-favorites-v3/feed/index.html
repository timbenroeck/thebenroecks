		<description><![CDATA[Just read the Hillary Frank piece you linked! Good stuff. Albeit frustrating that women/moms have to deal with that kind of pushback. I mean, we should all be hearing about pelvic floor issues ALL OF THE TIME in my opinion! And all other issues that create the need for postpartum PT! 

I&#039;m also about to check out the other link... I am reading a parenting book right now I like, but I also appreciate the idea (of Hillary&#039;s article) that one parenting approach does not work for all children - even children in the same family! Probably because I have two very different kids and am exhausted trying to figure out how to only minimally scar them for life ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhh I love it! I mean, if you have small space you could always just use a dust buster (which is what I did for a while!) but now that we have so much toddler food and dog hair all over everything, the big vacuum is more necessary!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would LOVE a Dyson vacuum. I don&#039;t hate vacuuming right now, but it is such a hassle, having to unplug it to move through the whole house, not to mention how freaking heavy it is. They&#039;re so pricey, but the convenience makes the price seem worth it....]]></description>
