		<description><![CDATA[Definitely take the test again! I was a Type 2 in high school, which didn&#039;t really resonate with me then, but I&#039;m not sure if I was necessarily a Type 7 then either... I did read in a book that we&#039;re actually supposed to type ourselves based on how we were before age 25 (or something like that) before external influences changed us. I mean, I&#039;m wording that badly but something like that. I&#039;m not sure peoples&#039; types necessarily change, but I do think that people give more self aware answers when they actually know who they are instead of who they WANT to be, so for me that means I know myself much better now! Although the types are based on childhood wounds so those wouldn&#039;t necessarily change... but I&#039;m not sure I even knew what my wounds were in high school, and I definitely had different ways to cope with them then. Definitely text me to tell me what you are, and have Mangesh take it, too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, I think I am going to have to re-gram myself. I remember doing this in high school so well, and still remember a lot of peopleâ€™s types from that point! I was a 7, and it HUGELY resonated with me - when we did it, I had just returned from spending the summer in Mexico on my own, was finding that colleges appealed to me largely based on adventure quotient, and was working two part-time jobs, advocating avidly for many causes, and taking computer class instead of study hall to keep myself busy! I donâ€™t think I was wrong at the time, but a lot has changed for me. I think your type isnâ€™t really supposed to change? But I think mine did? Will try again when I have a chance, maybe this weekend, and let you know how it goes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh this is kind of a long &#039;story&#039;! was actually laid off from my full time job a few months before I got pregnant with Clara, so being a SAHM kind of fell into my lap and I consider it a calling, albeit not a fun or easy one! Once I found out I was pregnant, I stopped looking for a permanent job and settled into some temp work instead, which I loved. Then I had Clara and it was basically just too hard for me to find a job within a year of having her, and I loved being at home with her full time when she was a baby. When Clara was a year old I got pregnant with Isabelle and we moved across the country so I decided to wait another year or so before job searching again. I started looking for a part time job last year (when Isabelle turned 2), but it&#039;s really hard to find a part time job that pays enough to afford childcare for two kids in Seattle, so I put it on hold again and continued to volunteer. Then the plan was for me to go back to work this fall, but of course now I&#039;m due with our third baby in the spring...! I still plan on going back, though, if we can figure out childcare.

Soooo long story short: 
- I didn&#039;t quit a career/job I loved to be a SAHM, which made it a much easier choice not to go back.
- Childcare is super expensive which has made it hard for me to go back part-time.
- Tim and I made the decision that it would be best for our family (and his work schedule) for me to stay home full-time for the first few years of starting a family. It&#039;s something we both value, but know it&#039;s not going to be a permanent arrangement. This is just a season of life.

BUT there are many days where I wish it was easier for me to just work part-time! I feel like that would be a sweet spot! 

Phew, I probably should just turn this response into a blog post! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope this doesnâ€™t come off as rude but over the years youâ€™ve mentioned numerous times how you donâ€™t really enjoy being a SAHM. Can I ask why you left your job to stay home?  I obviously donâ€™t know your finances but I figured as a CPA childcare wouldâ€™ve been affordable. Just curious because I have infant twins now and always pictured myself staying home, but then over maternity leave realized Iâ€™d lose my mind if I didnâ€™t go back to work lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh type 2s are some of my favorite people! Is the friend you&#039;re referring to a Type 8? That&#039;s what Tim is and I actually thought it was helpful reading about his type because although it may SEEM like he&#039;s being an a-hole, he&#039;s really just way more direct than most people. At least that&#039;s how I interpreted it. :-)

What type is your husband?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I love that your sister forced you all to do this! One of my best friends is a six, too! It&#039;s interesting that someone described loyalty as being a weakness - I&#039;ve never thought about it that way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My sister is SUPER into the enneagram and made us all figure out what type we are two Christmases ago. I&#039;m a six, though I certainly didn&#039;t need a quiz to help me figure that out, haha. I&#039;m very much a worrier, and I&#039;m also loyal to a FAULT (one of the most insightful things I ever had anyone else tell me about myself was that my loyalty is both my greatest strength and weakness, and I couldn&#039;t agree more). I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m about as six as they come.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I only recently discovered the enneagram test and found it super fascinating! I took 3 versions of it and got helper type 2 on all of them. In reading about type 2&#039;s both my brother and husband agreed that it absolutely described me. Now I&#039;m making everyone I know take them! haha It&#039;s so interesting though and I do think they&#039;re actually helpful. 

One friend took it and sent me her type and as I read through the common traits, it said something to the effect of &quot;often blunt but doesn&#039;t mean to be hurtful, is very direct&quot; and I was like OHH. I often worry I&#039;ve pissed her off or something but I think it&#039;s just her natural communication style. It&#039;s helped me not take things she says so personally.]]></description>
