		<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;s the plan ideally, but first the house needs to be finished and cleaned. Always easier said than done! I definitely have the &#039;before&#039; photos, though! Those were easy! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, that stinks about Tim! That doesn&#039;t sound like any fun at all. I hope he&#039;s able to be back to his normal self soon!


I started doing a 1SE-esque video in November (though I&#039;m using Leap Second, because it was free and I&#039;m cheap. Ha.), and so far I&#039;m really enjoying it! I was going to wait until January 1, but I was too antsy, haha. It&#039;s been really interesting to see just over the course of a month + a week how I&#039;ve picked up ideas on what to record, how to record it, etc. And it makes me look for something worth remembering in each day, which I think is a nice way to find joy in things that might seem mundane otherwise (like today, when my video was of me making my tea).]]></description>
