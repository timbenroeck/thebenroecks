		<description><![CDATA[Awww bummer about the blood draws but awesome he handles it so well! We have to go all the way to the children&#039;s hospital for blood draws because our ped doesn&#039;t do them - it&#039;s such a hassle!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m right there with you on being open and honest about shots.  Caleb has had to have a lot of blood draws recently and he&#039;s such a champ about them - I think a lot of it has to do with us being open and honest!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, Clara&#039;s braver than I am when it comes to shots! Haha. I can&#039;t even see the syringe without getting lightheaded, never mind watching someone actually administer the shot. But I do remember when I was younger, especially when I got my shots before kindergarten, how badly I wanted to be brave and not cry (and I didn&#039;t! Until later that night when I got home, which my parents attributed to post-vaccination irritability.) Clearly the bravery angle stands the test of time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My kids are polar opposites when it comes to shots. Ashford is cool as a clam and hardly notices when they do it. Azalea on the other hand, cries before, during and after her shots like they are the most traumatizing thing on earth to her. sighhhh :)]]></description>
