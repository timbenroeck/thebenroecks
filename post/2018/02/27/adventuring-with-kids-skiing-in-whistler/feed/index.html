		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m belated in responding but YES, the poor girl is still suffering and still can&#039;t have any dairy. We also had to take her off of most foods because EVERYTHING seemed to be making her sick. It is breaking my heart!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh no! That sounds like quite the virus Clara ended up coming down with - I didn&#039;t even know secondary lactose intolerance was something that could happen from a virus! I hope she feels better soon, and I&#039;m glad you had a nice trip :)]]></description>
