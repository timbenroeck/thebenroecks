		<description><![CDATA[Your &quot;love&quot; list is so extroverted! I love it! We share quite a few but some are sooooo not my cup of tea! (Although I love tea, so it&#039;s not that one.) Meeting new people wouldn&#039;t make my list ;) I love comfy blankets and hiking and yoga, though!]]></description>
