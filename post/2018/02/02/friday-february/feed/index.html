		<description><![CDATA[I wrote a whole blog post on this once... but I&#039;m not sure it takes that much more energy! The hardest part is just dealing with toddlers who can&#039;t communicate that clearly - but my girls are super interested in it so I don&#039;t have to do anything to convince them, I just show them where the potty is and encourage them to use it! (And clean. This all involves a lot of cleaning.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE Yoga with Adriene! That&#039;s my go-to whenever I want to do yoga. I haven&#039;t done any of her 30-day challenges in 30 consecutive days, but I&#039;m very slowly working my way through the first one (as in, I started last summer. Haha. But I started during marathon season, and sometimes wanted a longer session than the videos provided, so I had to deviate to other ones she has instead). I seriously think she&#039;s the greatest.]]></description>
