		<description><![CDATA[I love this so much!!! The neighbors in our circle don&#039;t have any kids our age, but whenever our kids see the neighbors on their back borch they run out and yell, &quot;Hi NEIGHBORS!!&quot; and wave to them through the window. When our neighbors to one side are out working in their yard, our kids can be found chatting with them through the fence and their girls inevitably end up in our yard playing with the kids, which helps me out. A good neighborhood is key to enjoying any area! I&#039;m glad you have good neighbors!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to hear you&#039;re liking your new neighborhood! I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll make a huge difference. I think having kids in a neighborhood where other people have kids about the same age can make it really easy to connect with your neighbors. Out of all the neighbors we had growing up, the only ones we regularly spent time with were the ones next door, because they had kids around the same age as my siblings and me. My parents would talk with the other neighbors, of course, and we all exchanged Christmas goodies (you know, the important things :P ), but the only ones who came over to our house and actually hung out with my parents were the ones next door - their kids would come over, so they&#039;d come over, and the next thing you knew the grownups were hanging out with each other just like the kids!]]></description>
