		<description><![CDATA[I love that you shared that it&#039;s important to go! We go to Breckenridge every other year, and next year our baby will be 11 months old. My sister-in-law has volunteered to watch her while I ski for a day or two, but I am still stressing a little. My husband and I have such a routine when we travel, things are about to be turned upside down for a little while, but I can&#039;t wait for our family adventures!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s part of Emmy&#039;s problem... she had to be at home and only held by us for so long to keep her healthy that she has a hard time trusting other people and sobs if we leave her. Bensen has similar issues due to that year that we had him quarantined with Emmy (ok, so it wasn&#039;t a whole year), but he does a lot better than she does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love how often you guys get up &#038; go. I think it&#039;s super special that you spend time with friends and rent out whole houses or areas for your families. Your trips always sound like so much fun!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure whether my kids just never had stranger danger or whether it&#039;s just that we left them and didn&#039;t care about their preferences - haha! Now they have zero loyalty to us and we are able to leave them with whoever!]]></description>
