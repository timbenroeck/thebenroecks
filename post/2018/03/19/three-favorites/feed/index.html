		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t been watching March Madness in the sense that I&#039;ve actually watched any of the games, but I have most definitely been following along and have been anxiously awaiting Thursday when I&#039;ll have the chance to brag about my bracket in a blog post :P Hahaha. My top performing bracket (of the five I made) is currently in the 88.8th percentile on ESPN! It was in the 97th percentile at one point on Sunday, but I didn&#039;t fare so well after the UNC and Cincinnati losses. I&#039;m 30 points behind my dad in our family pool, but four of the five of us have the same number of potential points per round for the next round at the moment (1080), so we&#039;ll see what happens. (My sister, having called Michigan State to win it all, only has 200 PPR available. Ouch.) I can&#039;t believe that Loyola is still in it! I really thought they only got in on a technicality (winning their conference), but no matter what happens at their next game, it seems like they really are the real deal, making it all the way to the Sweet Sixteen!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I married my husband he wasn&#039;t into sport. Then I introduced him to NASCAR. Then we ended up at a Cavs game with friends and now he&#039;s really into them. THEN he started watching the Indians in the spring/summer. I&#039;m just PRAYING that he doesn&#039;t get hooked on another sport/division. Hahaha. No March Madness in our house!
I feel like I definitely need to look into this book after that rave review.]]></description>
