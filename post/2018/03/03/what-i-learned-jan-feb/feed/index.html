		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, my sister is ob.sessed. with the Enneagram. She tried to explain her relationship with another person to me in terms of the Enneagram, which meant absolutely nothing to me, so then she made my whole family look it up when we were all home for Christmas (and say what we thought everyone else in the family was, too - we were usually all in agreement with each other!). I believe I decided I was a 6, mostly because it includes &quot;anxious&quot; as a descriptor, and if that&#039;s not me, I don&#039;t know what is, hahaha. I don&#039;t really care all that much for personality quiz type things, but it was still interesting to read through.]]></description>
