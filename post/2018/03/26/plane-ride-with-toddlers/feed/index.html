		<description><![CDATA[I feel like it was a blessing that the first trip went so well. You&#039;d have been so worried and anxious if your trip to FL was like the trip home... You probably wouldn&#039;t have gotten on the plane. LOL
Glad 1/2 your travel and successful and stress-free(ish)!!]]></description>
