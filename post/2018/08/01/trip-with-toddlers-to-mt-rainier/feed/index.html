		<description><![CDATA[Hi Allie! Honestly we didn&#039;t spend much time at Crystal Mountain, because we were just filling up some time between lunch and dinner and our campsite was pretty near there. The girls&#039; favorite part of the experience was the gondola ride up and down. There is a snack bar at the top, as well as the restaurant, but I didn&#039;t think my two toddlers could sit long enough to enjoy that experience! We did see people hiking around, which seemed fun, but we chose to hike other trails during the morning and so just relaxed on the chairs overlooking Mt Rainier once we got up to the top of the gondola, and then we just spent a few minutes walking around and headed back down. It was a little chilly and windy up there so be prepared for that! You could also pack a picnic lunch, because there are tables up there to eat at!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mt. Rainier is so beautiful! She&#039;s definitely my favorite mountain. It&#039;s always such a treat when I see her when I&#039;m in Seattle (especially the past few times, since my trips over the last 10 years or so have more often been in the fall/winter than in the summer). We went to the park itself I believe in 2001, and I remember particularly liking it because there was still snow on the ground and it was either June or July. One of these days I&#039;ll have to go out during the summer again and visit the park!]]></description>
