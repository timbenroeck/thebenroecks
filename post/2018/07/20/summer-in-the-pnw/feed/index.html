		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found all this to be pretty true for Portland too. I knew it would be different, but I didn&#039;t know how different! We don&#039;t have A/C in our apartment and we have only missed it one day. It may get up to the 80s or even low 90s but it never lasts long. The next day it will probably be back down in the 60s. Also, yeah everybody is out and about. We just spent a weekend at Crater Lake. And we&#039;re going to Silver Falls in a couple weeks. Summer here is THE BEST!]]></description>
