		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m REALLY late in responding but I will say this past weekend we went camping at a campground without showers and there wasn&#039;t a lake nearby and my girls got FILTHY. I definitely prefer to camp near a lake for a quick clean-off!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a Canadian store that rents out a ton of camping equipment so I always recommend that to people who aren&#039;t sure if they want to commit to the gear or not! And yes...everyone will get dirty but that makes the shower so much more fun at home :) We also like camping close to a lake or the ocean so we can rinse off :)]]></description>
