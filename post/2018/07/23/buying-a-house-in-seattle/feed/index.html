		<description><![CDATA[I thought the market in Colorado was hot. We had two offers the day after our house went on the market, and one was over asking (by $5000, not $100,000). I cannot imagine the stress of waiving contingencies and paying that much over asking. Glad y&#039;all found a place!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh I can&#039;t even imagine the prices in SoCal... although we&#039;re probably getting closer to that level here! We had friends who ended up having to pay an extra $200k in cash because they waived the finance contingency and their house was appraised for way under what they paid for it. It&#039;s really just stressful and chaotic and people can get very screwed over if they aren&#039;t careful or if they don&#039;t have a good realtor! Good luck on your housing search/selling!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just in the burbs of Philly the other month for a bridal shower! And yeah, it&#039;s crazy how far over asking these houses are going for... negotiations aren&#039;t even an option - everyone just gives their best and final offer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I didn&#039;t realize the market was so hot over there, too! It&#039;s so hard to make such big life choices in the span of a few hours... nice for the sellers but it definitely makes it stressful for buyers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s super weird to make such a big life decision in the span of a few hours! I don&#039;t know how other people do it... and am really thankful that me and Tim have flexible schedules so we could find a house. But there is no WAY we would have survived months and months of that chaos!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh ma goodness. So Cal real estate is expensive (my city is usually in top 5, always below SF), and moves fast, but not that fast and furious. That&#039;s insane! The idea of waiving contingencies AND having to pay 1-200k over asking is insane. How many people must end up stuck without sufficient financing?? It&#039;s just not right. We&#039;re currently in the selling and buying situation and I&#039;m finding it incredibly stressful as is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;m not in a hot market, but I am in a huge medical area, and we moved to town at the beginning of the &quot;medical new year&quot; when everyone new comes. Good grief, houses would be gone in under an hour!]]></description>
