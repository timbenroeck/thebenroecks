		<description><![CDATA[Well you solo-parent way more than I do and I don&#039;t know how you do it while keeping your sanity! Honestly, it was really not that hard for me to solo-parent with one kid (the few times I did it) but with our two girls it feels really impossible, mainly because nights are still such a toss up and the girls rarely BOTH sleep through. I am all about hiring help when needed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I’ll be honest, even with just me and the dog at home, I’m so used to having Mangesh with me now that I kinda freak out and it feels so weird when one of us is away without the other. Even if he’s just out for the evening and coming home late, I have such a hard time getting myself to bed and going to sleep without him!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oh boy. when you&#039;re used to having your husband around all the time, i definitely think it&#039;s way harder to have them gone for any amount of time. it throws everything off! i&#039;m way impressed with people who do that. when they&#039;re gone more often, you are able to get used to it and it becomes second nature after a while. i mean, i&#039;m still all about survival mode, and lowering those expectations way down, those are some good tips up there!]]></description>
