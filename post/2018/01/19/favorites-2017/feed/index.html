		<description><![CDATA[Oh, this was SO FUN to read! My best friend loves TinyBeans! I get an email with her updates every day. :) I&#039;ve heard such good things about Jen Hatmaker&#039;s podcast, so I don&#039;t know why I always forget about it as an option when looking for new podcasts. This is a fun way to do a year-end summary post! I feel like I learned so much about you rather quickly. :)]]></description>
