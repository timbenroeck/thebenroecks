		<description><![CDATA[i still say that the biggest lie anyone tells parents is that your child will eventually sleep through the night all the time. because they never really get there. something always comes up. especially when there are two of them. gah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of my greatest fears about having a second child! We just switched our 18 month old from one nap to turn and bedtime back to 8 and she still wakes up between 5-6AM. Shes a good napper but the nights were hit or miss for the first year. I fear the day she can start crawling out of her crib on her own!! All I can say is you are doing a great job!!!!]]></description>
