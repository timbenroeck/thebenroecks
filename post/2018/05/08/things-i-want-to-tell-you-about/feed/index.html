		<description><![CDATA[Our financial advisor is the one who recommended we should buy... bleh. I mean, I love renting for lots and lots of reasons, so this is a big step for me personally! I do see the benefits of giving kids a house they can stay in for more than a few years though, and the fear is that we won&#039;t be able to afford any house in the Seattle area soon with prices continuing to rise... not to mention interest rates! 

I agree with you about the friends thing - a lot of my friends are in separate groups, and know different parts of me than other groups might, if that even makes sense! I realized after talking to some of our high school peoples in the past month that they remember things about me that I actually don&#039;t even remember! So in some ways it seems that they know me better than friends I&#039;ve met more recently, but in some ways it seems that their image of me might be more biased towards the past than how I would see myself now. I&#039;m going to have to think more about it!]]></description>
