		<description><![CDATA[I could go for a good mattress date... We&#039;re in need of a new one soon.
I loved watching the wedding :) I woke up at 5 and watched the coverage/ceremony for nearly 5 hours! I really loved her dress... I thought it was perfectly simple. I like that kind of style but to each their own :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re still regretting taking Bensen out of the crib and it&#039;s been over a year. Emmy&#039;s going to be in her crib until we have another kid or she moves away fro college. The latter is more likely right now ;)

Also, mattress shopping for date night is good! We did that for my birthday one year haha]]></description>
