		<description><![CDATA[I never ever ever travel alone. I travel with just friends, but that&#039;s it. I wonder if I&#039;d enjoy it... The housing market can be SO frustrating sometimes. I truly feel like we got lucky but there was still blood sweat and tears involved. UGH.
I love how observant you are to your own patterns and behavior. I&#039;ve never thought about which day I&#039;m most productive and how to tweak my schedule accordingly. Most of my social things are scheduled for Tues. Wed. Sat. but beyond that I don&#039;t pay any attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We sold our home in Seattle nearly a year ago.  It was crazy how much our tiny house went for!  I know we will be moving back in a few years and I’m terrified about what will happen in the meantime.  Definitely write a letter and include a picture of your family... it could make the difference in the end!  I know it did when we bought 4 years ago and it was a huge factor for us when choosing which offer to accept.]]></description>
