		<description><![CDATA[Dang, that&#039;s annoying. Especially when SW will do all that for ya. It means the other companies technically *could* do it, they just won&#039;t. Boo on them. Glad you had safe and relatively painless travels, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I typically fly United, and a year or so ago they added a &quot;Basic Economy&quot; option (or something like that). It&#039;s a cheaper ticket, but you don&#039;t get an assigned seat, and you&#039;re not allowed to bring carry-ons onto the plane either, other than a personal item that you can put under the seat in front of you. You can still buy a normal economy seat, though, and get the assigned seat/carry-on privileges like usual.]]></description>
