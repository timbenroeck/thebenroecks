		<description><![CDATA[Man... I can&#039;t get over how gorgeous those fields of tulips are. It&#039;s definitely worth the unpredictable toddler behavior! And you come away with wonderful pictures so don&#039;t stop ;) I think your girls will have hundreds of memories for their annual trips, even if they&#039;re a little fussy at this age :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, those fields are SO beautiful! I&#039;m impressed that the tulips are blooming so beautifully in Washington - I&#039;m sure we&#039;re weeks away from that happening here. The daffodils have only barely started to come out! But I suppose that&#039;s what happens when the mercury can barely crack 40 on any given day. We&#039;ll be getting our spring flowers in June this year! Haha.]]></description>
