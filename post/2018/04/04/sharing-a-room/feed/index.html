		<description><![CDATA[How fun that they&#039;re loving it!  What a great idea to do the toddler bed and room sharing transition at the same time!  I&#039;ll have to remember that for when Josiah&#039;s ready to be in a toddler bed since the end goal is for the boys to share a room and an eventual baby #3 to have Josiah&#039;s room.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone locks their kids in their rooms, right?! I mean, maybe not always, but at least some of the time when doing the transition to a toddler bed! We did it wayyyy more for Clara than we&#039;ve needed to for Isabelle, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, 6 months! You really went after it! Bravo! It sounds like you guys have quite the shenanigans going on at night over there! ;-) Sometimes Clara will hop into Isabelle&#039;s bed to snuggle her if she&#039;s crying too much. However, Isabelle never appreciates the extra love and it turns into a complete sh*t show. Sigh. Toddlers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha! I never had to share a room either, but it&#039;s because I had brothers! Well, now that I think about it, I guess I did share in the college dorms, and I loved it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mine share a room! R is 2.5 and J is 9.5 months. We put them in the same room when J was 6 months old. It sometimes goes really well and other times.... sometimes he&#039;s sleeping and she wiill reach through the crib bars and pinch him and wake him up. WHY. R escapes her toddler bed all the time and it&#039;s super obnoxious.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad I never had to share a room, lol!! At least, not that I remember. I think when I was SUPER young (2 or 3) my infant brother was in a room with me for a few months, but then we moved houses and we each got our own bedrooms :) Great job with the girls!! That&#039;s impressive!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad I&#039;m not the only one who locks my child&#039;s door from the outside.... The other morning I realized I&#039;d left Bensen&#039;s unlocked, but he never tried to escape, so, I think that&#039;s a win... maybe??? My hat&#039;s off to you for getting them to share a room, that&#039;s one of my deterrents from having a 3rd, someone&#039;s going to have to share and I don&#039;t know if I can handle that hahaha. But it sounds like it&#039;s working out really well for you and I&#039;m glad!!]]></description>
