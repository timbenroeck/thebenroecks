		<description><![CDATA[Oh MAN! Feeding the flamingos looks SO cool! I just got back yesterday from a trip to Punta Cana, and one of my favorite parts about the trip was watching the flamingos at the resort - getting to actually feed one from your hands sounds 100 times better than just watching them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a bummer when you get to the beach and then can&#039;t enjoy the beach! Crazy 2018 weather. I was kind of cracking up at the photos of you in a tank and Clara in a fleece jacket. That kind of sums up this spring, doesn&#039;t it? Glad you guys were able to still have some fun and make good memories!]]></description>
