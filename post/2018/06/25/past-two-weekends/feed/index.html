		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll join with everyone and tell you to majorly overplan on the project ;) We thought ours would take two months when we bought our house, we moved in three months into the process, couldn&#039;t live in the master bedroom until they finished the bathroom remodel two months in and had another month after that until they finished the basement and our house was no longer covered in layers of dust. Now we&#039;re doing our deck and well... it&#039;s already taken twice as long as we thought, we&#039;ve added other projects (like a new sprinkler system) and I&#039;m not sure if we&#039;ll be done projecting in time to enjoy the summer :P But I&#039;m crossing my fingers that your project goes swimmingly!!! I&#039;m excited to see what you do!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOVE Dave Matthews Band! What a fun bachelorette party!
Moving and fixing up a house is tough (and exhausting) work! Treat yourself to a few manicures during the process ;) Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES to all the home renovation posts!! The bachelorette weekend sounded like so much fun, too! I&#039;ve never been a Dave fan but I know many people who are and they always LOVE his concerts. True Crime Obsessed is totally my favorite podcast too! They are hilarious!! I&#039;m waiting until they get through all the Serial episodes to become a Patreon sponsor so I can binge them.]]></description>
