		<description><![CDATA[SAME. Also, did you check out the Powersheets?! I really do love them. It helped in my goal setting so much this past year because I was able to feel like I accomplished so much more overall, but was also able to focus on what really mattered to me on any particular month.. if that makes sense!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps is the reason some of my days have way more screentime than others! So of course I stopped using it to stay under my limit and promptly got lost going EVERYWHERE. Hahaha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My screen time increased last week by more than 70000%... but it was because I drove a couple places with GoogleMaps on the whole time, and I read a bunch of articles in research journals! So, I think the screentime measurement is not very fair â€” I wish it would at least not count driving time as true screentime!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Screen Time has DEFINITELY been an eye-opener for me. I set 1:30 limits for myself on a couple apps/app categories, which seemed reasonable at the time, but it&#039;s crazy how often I hit those limits (...and often end up overriding them. Oops.). It has encouraged me to stop wasting so much time on my phone, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Screen Time ruined my life. And now that Iâ€™m nursing again? DONE. My goals these days are basically to make sure that we get places on time and I remember to feed everyone meals. So maybe next year for more official goal setting?]]></description>
