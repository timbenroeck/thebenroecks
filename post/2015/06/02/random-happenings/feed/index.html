		<description><![CDATA[First, I love that skirt! 


Second, the same thing happened with my sisters and I with our Dad growing up. He&#039;s always had a mustache or beard. Well, once he had a beard, but then went back to a mustache and it was the weirdest thing ever. So weird. Anyways, he&#039;s back to a beard and it fits him perfectly. I&#039;m not sure I would know who he was if he ever shaved it off. ha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I know, right?! I mean, it&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing but it was really heartbreaking for Tim! Although, at least now he&#039;s shaving consistently so he doesn&#039;t need to go through that whole thing again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HAHAHAHAHA what a funny story about Clara! When I was in college, I sat next to this kid with a big ol&#039; full beard in one of my classes, and one day fairly late in the semester I walked into class, saw a new kid sitting in the seat next to mine, and thought it was awfully strange that someone new had joined class more than halfway through the semester. Welp, turns out it was the same guy: he had just shaved his beard. I had NO IDEA. It was wild!]]></description>
