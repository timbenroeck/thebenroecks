		<description><![CDATA[I definitely think the Whole30 is sustainable. The only thing is that it takes A LOT of preparation. It&#039;s kind of high maintenance until you get used to it and get in a rhythm. I went into it knowing that my first time wasn&#039;t going to be perfect, but from the time I did complete, I noticed lots of good changes. I&#039;ll definitely be trying again in the future. With the hopes of making it all the way to day 30. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My in-laws put SUGAR on raspberries for dessert.  Pretty sure my eyes bulged way out of my head when I saw them do that.  Because you know, raspberries aren&#039;t sweet enough.
I&#039;m really bad for eating cake and cookies as main dishes too.  :(  Something I definitely need to work on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have heard about Whole30 but I haven&#039;t looked into it so I really know nothing about it. Was it too hard to stick to? That&#039;s kind of why I never looked into it, I wasn&#039;t sure it seemed sustainable. Definitely watch &#039;Fed Up&#039; when you get a chance! (And let me know what you thought!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t watched Fed Up, but I think it&#039;s on &quot;My List&quot; on Netflix. Have you heard about the Whole30? I recently attempted it for the first time (not successfully), but for the time that I was doing well and being compliant it was amazing and has changed the way I eat! I&#039;m also reading their book It Starts with Food and it&#039;s so eye-opening and revealing. The way I eat has definitely changed. Looking forward to watching Fed Up. I&#039;m not like this giant conspirator on the government or anything, but it&#039;s amazing how so much is tied together, especially when it comes to our health and what we do or do not eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel the same way! I know I&#039;ll &#039;cheat&#039;, but I really think I can keep only good foods in our house and then eat junk food as the EXCEPTION instead of as a part of my normal diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today I had a bit of chocolate cake, so definitely yes! But I&#039;m way more aware of what I&#039;m eating now and I think eventually I&#039;ll try to cut down on sweet treats almost altogether, We&#039;ll see, though! I&#039;m more concerned with what I eat on my normal days as opposed to exception days.]]></description>
