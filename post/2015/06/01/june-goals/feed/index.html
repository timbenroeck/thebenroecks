		<description><![CDATA[150 minutes is a great goal! Are you reading anything good lately? I&#039;ve always thought about writing a newsletter (but via email) for long distance family and friends, but then I feel awkward talking about myself like that... I can&#039;t decide if it would be appreciated or not! I think it might be a good thing though, thoughts?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Getting 150 min of physical activity a week. Books are on mine too (I set a NY resolution to read 10 min a day....it&#039;s been a struggle). I also want to send out a big snail mail out to family and friends, newsletter style :) so I will work on putting together a &quot;year in review&quot; for that. I love setting at least a couple of goals a month!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are great!  I can totally relate and have some of the same things on my list for this month, too! It&#039;s incredible how getting dressed up in something other than stretchy pants and putting on a little makeup can make you feel like a million bucks!]]></description>
