		<description><![CDATA[Awwww those moments with your daughter sound so special! I do love certain aspects of this stage, but overall I&#039;m just feeling mentally and physically drained each and every day! Although, I will say that every day she communicates more and more effectively and that makes it much easier!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know, I think the clinginess is a developmental thing right now because it&#039;s relatively new... and also I&#039;ve been sitting down a lot more lately and she just does not like when I&#039;m sitting down and not paying complete attention to her! I&#039;m hoping as she gets a few months older she&#039;ll be more interested in playing by herself, especially if I can start setting up little crafts for her that she&#039;ll be able to do soon!  But maybe you&#039;re right, maybe the move impacted her more than I realized. Plus, Tim&#039;s been in the office every single day and he used to work from home, so we aren&#039;t used to this new routine. Gosh, I guess there are lots of reasons she could be extra-cranky lately! Thanks for making me think a little more about it and for your encouragement! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! Aunt-hood does sound like the best strategy. Although, when well-meaning relatives fill your child with candy and give them back to you.... from a parent&#039;s perspective that&#039;s not-so-fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You do NOT need to feel guilty! You&#039;re a GREAT mom, even in the hard times... that&#039;s something to be PROUD of yourself for! :)
Although I do think you&#039;re an evil b word for not picking her up a 6th time. THE NERVE! ;P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[no need to feel guilty!


I have to say, I really love the aunt life. I get to play with my nephews and niece and then when they start crying over ridiculous things (like when we gave one of my nephews grape juice and not wine like the adults) I give them back to mama. :)]]></description>
