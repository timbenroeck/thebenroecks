		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Amber!! I honestly think pregnancy SUCKS in the first 16 weeks (for me) or so, but then it&#039;s the most magical thing ever for the rest of the time. Well, until it gets super uncomfortable, but that&#039;s at the end and I think it&#039;s nature&#039;s/God&#039;s way of making us look forward to labor, because even that pain is better than the idea of walking around forever with a huge baby in your abdomen. Ah, the miracle of life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know I already said congratulations and that this post isn&#039;t the newest of yours (although I already read all of those through thoroughly), this is the best pregnancy recap ever. It makes everything feel real but not so daunting... Sometimes the detailed recaps scare me half to death with all their facts and biz. 

But mostly CONGRATULATIONS. My heart lept when I saw the announcement on Facebook.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[THANKS! I guess I do love life when it&#039;s unpredictable... but it was a lot to handle all at once! Although, now that I&#039;m feeling better, I&#039;m totally enjoying everything that&#039;s going on right now! So exciting :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I&#039;m like TOTALLY pregnant, as this bump keeps reminding me! It definitely popped out sooner this second time around :-) And I&#039;ll be writing a post in a few days (weeks? who knows.) about not finding out the gender and maybe that will convince your husband ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh it was definitely exhausting. Looking back (now that I feel better) I can&#039;t believe we all survived it in one piece. Thanks for the kind words and support (per usual)!]]></description>
