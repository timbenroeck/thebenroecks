		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m watching the Seahawks right now... I really wish they could pull this win off, because it&#039;s been a great game, but alas, it&#039;s not going to happen in the last minute! I guess in Seattle they wear Seahawks gear EVERY Friday. Who knew?! 


I was at an ER on the west side, so no Evergreen for me! Although, I&#039;ve heard that hospital is nice from some mom friends I&#039;ve met here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry you were so sick! I immediately picked up my phone to text you and then remembered that I&#039;m in Canada, and I don&#039;t have the right type of phone to have service in Vancouver, however that works, so I&#039;m going to make sure I text you when I get home! Or if you&#039;re on Hangout later, message me, because I&#039;m on that constantly up here :) It&#039;s my texting alternative.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh did you go to ER at Evergreen Hospital in Totem Lake?? That&#039;s a very lovely hospital (and where I spent the vast majority of my vacation in Seattle, as that&#039;s where my grandma was). The ER is quite nice, though I suppose I&#039;ve never been to any other ERs, so maybe I don&#039;t really know :P Anyway, I hope you&#039;re feeling a lot better now!


Also, YES to the Seahawks thing. HOLY SMOKES, I was absolutely blown away by the Seahawks mania when I was out there. The Cubs were just starting to implode at the time, but it was mind-boggling to me to compare the rabid enthusiasm about the Seahawks to Cubs fandom, which, honestly, seemed quite tame in comparison (though to be fair, I didn&#039;t spend any time in hospitals in Chicago during the World Series, so maybe I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about). I also wondered if maybe I was just more aware of it because seeing Seahawks things is obviously novel compared to what I&#039;m used to in Chicago, but I really think the excitement about the Seahawks is unparalleled. The Seahawks played the 49ers the Thursday I was out there, and I kid you not, I bet at least 75% of the hospital staff--the STAFF!--were wearing Seahawks gear! The ER has a 12 decal that must have been six feet by eight feet, I bet. Heck, I left wishing *I* had put down $90 for a jersey, and I don&#039;t even live in Seattle! (Though to be fair, I have always cheered for Seattle teams, as I consider myself half-Seattleite ;) ). I don&#039;t blame you for switching alliances. Given the choice between the Bears and the Seahawks, I&#039;d go with the Seahawks every time :)]]></description>
