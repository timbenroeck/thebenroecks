		<description><![CDATA[DO IT! The only thing is that I can&#039;t decide whether to track things when I actually get rid of them or when I put them in bags that will EVENTUALLY be gotten rid of.... because right now I have bags and bags of &#039;to be donated&#039; bags in my basement and I&#039;m not sure whether that counts as actually getting rid of things or not!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I do a semi-capsule wardrobe but I&#039;m not good at sticking to a certain number of clothes/accessories.  I more just attempt to keep what&#039;s in my closet to a minimum, which is always easier said than done! I&#039;ll be intrigued as to how it goes for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Heather! I&#039;m a little behind the &#039;schedule&#039; but I think I can make it up the next few days! I love a good challenge, especially one that ends up with me having a more organized/clean house :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See, that was my goal and it just didn&#039;t happen! I wanted to go through EVERYTHING and not move anything we didn&#039;t want - but we ran out of time and ended up just having the movers pack absolutely everything and now as I unpack I&#039;m thinking, &#039;WHY DO I HAVE THIS?!&#039; so now I&#039;m decluttering on this end of the move! Do you feel so much better after decluttering?!]]></description>
