		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely always easier to see God&#039;s plan and His hands in my life in hindsight! When I&#039;m in the midst of a challenge I tend to feel like God&#039;s just ignoring me and then afterwards I&#039;m always like &#039;ahhhhh now I get it!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh that is amazing how it worked out for you! It sounds like God was definitely waiting to present you with this awesome opportunity to work from home, although I&#039;m sure it was frustrating to not be able to find a job in Columbus for those few months!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is something I identify with completely. And I love that song! Just a quick example: I graduated from college a semester before my husband (then fiance) and I went &quot;home,&quot; started working, lived with my parents, and saved up for our life together once he graduated. Then he got into grad school at Ohio State so we would be moving to Columbus, Oh (from Atlanta) after we got married. I started looking for a job in Columbus but nobody was biting. There were many reasons, I was living too far away and they didn&#039;t want to do phone interviews, I was right out of college and they wanted experience etc. After 2 months of looking and praying, my boss in Atlanta told me they wanted to keep me when we moved and that I could work from home in Ohio. I am so glad God &quot;didn&#039;t answer&quot; my prayers for finding a job in Ohio!]]></description>
