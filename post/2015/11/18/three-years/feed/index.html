		<description><![CDATA[Seriously! Tim and I are definitely going to try to do date night every other week now that we know Clara is okay with babysitters. Hopefully we can convince that same one to come back.... And I would LOVE IT if you could come visit - tell Joe that big cities aren&#039;t all that bad!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The food was actually better than I anticipated, given that I&#039;m sure you&#039;re mostly paying for the view! As a perk, the Microsoft discount card got us a buy one get one deal on the entrees, so I thought it was definitely worth it. It was a great spot for our first date night in Seattle but I probably won&#039;t rush to go back now that we&#039;ve done it once!]]></description>
