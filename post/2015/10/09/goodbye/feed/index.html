		<description><![CDATA[I think you said it so well, it will definitely be the little things that I&#039;ll probably end up missing the most! Especially the things that I assume people do the same everywhere that it turns out only Chicago people do. And I KNOW I&#039;ll miss being in the city as the Cubs continue in the playoffs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are so right, I think there&#039;s definitely an advantage to making quick decisions and taking immediate action... less time to dwell on things and for anxiety to build! Especially since I get anxious about the IDEA of things moreso than the actual thing itself, if that makes sense. It will definitely be interesting to see what I actually end up missing about Chicago, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s going to end up being quite a long list.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so right, sometimes I leave places thinking &#039;I could always come back&#039; but I know I actually won&#039;t. In this case we KNOW we&#039;ll be back to Chicago!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s much easier to leave a place when you know it isn&#039;t forever, and in this case, you don&#039;t even have to delude yourself into thinking, &quot;Oh, this won&#039;t be forever!&quot; when deep down you know it really is. With both of your families being out here, you&#039;ll definitely come back, and &quot;see you laters&quot; are SO much easier than &quot;goodbyes,&quot; in my opinion! Good luck with the move! I can only imagine what kind of logistical nightmare coordinating a cross-country move must be...I had a hard enough time getting myself organized to move 1.5 miles from one neighborhood to another last year, and that was just me and my things, not a whole family!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Moving and making new friends is always challenging, but I have no doubt you&#039;ll survive well :) I recently went to Seattle for the first time ever... We stayed a long weekend and 4 days was not enough! It is one of my favorite cities that I&#039;ve visited and I cannot wait to return! It is a young, vibrant, edgy city with lots of outdoor activities. I now understand why people rave about it. Best of luck with your move!]]></description>
