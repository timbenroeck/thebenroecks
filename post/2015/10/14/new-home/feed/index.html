		<description><![CDATA[Our stuff is on the way... somewhere... hahaha! They&#039;re thinking it will get here in another week but who knows?! It will be moved to a storage unit until we move into a &#039;permanent&#039; rental. 


Unfortunately, I don&#039;t let Clara have &#039;screen time&#039; just yet, so she&#039;s going to be deprived from the United logo until she flies again... haha! On airplanes I&#039;m willing to do ANYTHING to get her to sit still, so TV time is definitely encouraged on flights! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha I&#039;m definitely curled up in a ball but I have my laptop on my lap so I just need to write to get it all out! The flight to Seattle is definitely long, but worth it! It&#039;s been beautiful here lately :-) I&#039;ll definitely put in a request for good weather for you! &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you! Do you live here as well? I can&#039;t imagine traveling to Europe... these 2 hours are brutal enough! Hopefully it won&#039;t take too much time for her little body to adjust, because today she woke up at 4am and it was kind of a brutal day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Eventful&#039; is an understatement! ;-) So overwhelming but at the same time it was really smooth. Thank you SO much for the continued prayers. I can seriously feel God&#039;s peace surrounding us in this time.]]></description>
