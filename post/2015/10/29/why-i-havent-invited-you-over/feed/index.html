		<description><![CDATA[I really loved reading &#039;Carry on Warrior&#039; because it talks a lot about showing up exactly as you are and not worrying about having a clean house, perfect dinner, etc etc. I can always use that reminder!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha well granted, I was always decently bad at inviting people over to our actual house, but I was great at making plans to go out places! Hopefully in Feb/March people will invite themselves over so you can have lots of guests visiting the baby and you with minimal effort on your part!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ahh, I&#039;m so so bad at this and I don&#039;t even have the excuse (yet!) of having a baby in the house. :( The realization that come Feb/March I&#039;ll be juggling friends and a baby, though, has spurred me into action and lately I&#039;ve been trying to be better about inviting people over - especially for dinner! We&#039;ve only ever had TWO couples over for dinner in our entire year and a half of living here. Oops. :( I definitely think most people understand, though! Especially those in their late twenties/early thirties with their own crazy schedules.
