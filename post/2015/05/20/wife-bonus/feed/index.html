		<description><![CDATA[WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!  I&#039;m seriously flabbergasted by the idea of a &quot;wife bonus!&quot;  I&#039;m a sahm too but there&#039;s no way my husband would even think of telling me how much money I can spend (unless we, as a couple, are needing to be saving for any reason).  We talk about any big purchases and know what&#039;s reasonable to spend on small purchases.  Nate trusts me, I trust him, and just because he&#039;s making the money does not mean I&#039;m not pulling my fair share of work too.  Raising a baby is HARD!  Nate and I are a team and our finances reflect that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness. The &#039;wife bonus&#039; idea makes me so mad! One of the counselors we went to for pre-marital counseling recommended the book &quot;Man of Steel and Velvet&quot; for my husband to read and one of the first things it talked about was giving your wife an allowance and ruling the family with your financial power. Needless to say, the hubby did not finish the book. And I think he threw it away. I think the book was written a long time ago and I really liked that counselor so I&#039;ve often wondered if he ever really read the book or if he had within the last 20 years anyway. Right now, I actually make more money than my husband because he is still in grad school. But that doesn&#039;t mean anything. Our bank account is full of OUR money! Not his or mine. We are equal in this respect and in every other way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A wife bonus???  The whole idea seems so foreign to me!  I&#039;m so glad my parents (and my husband&#039;s parents) lived their lives equal to each other, although assuming different roles.  It makes me sad when our society at large seems to put more value on a person&#039;s paycheque than on their life&#039;s work.  Every now and again I ask my husband if he still thinks it&#039;s a good idea for me to be at home and he always gives the same answer - that what I do at home is one of the greatest things I could be doing for our family.  (I should clarify that I agree with him.  I just think it doesn&#039;t hurt to ask every now and again.)  I know that if I wanted to and it was best for our family, he would support me going back to work too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be honest, if I needed to &#039;earn&#039; a bonus, I wouldn&#039;t be getting any extra money! I think it&#039;s important to do household things for the FAMILY, not to make someone happy so they give you a bonus. Ughhh I could rant about this for a while!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree. Part of me can relate to the women in the article in terms of wanting to be great moms and contribute to society (volunteering) with different organizations. However, I don&#039;t understand these intelligent, strong women putting themselves into a position in which they need their husbands to &#039;gift&#039; them money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Natalie! I agree with you - people truly amaze me and I can&#039;t believe some relationships/marriages function as they do! I don&#039;t think marriage is about proving our worth or earning anything (especially a bonus), I think it should be about unconditional love and acceptance and above all - sharing as a partnership!]]></description>
