		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not going to lie, the photography class I&#039;m taking is expensive but I&#039;m OBSESSED with it. And of course I love my DSLR and would highly, highly recommend it! (But seriously, if you buy one take a class and don&#039;t wait years like I did!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like such a great assignment! Makes me want to both buy an SLR *and* take your photography class haha. I&#039;d love to think I know something about photography, but realistically I know so little -- I bet there&#039;s so much I could learn with a class...and if I had a camera other than my iPhone :P]]></description>
