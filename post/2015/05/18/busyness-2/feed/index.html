		<description><![CDATA[It sounds like you&#039;ve managed to strike a great balance! When I was working I really was able to relax better at home when I was busy at work, but now the lines are blurred since my &#039;work&#039; is with Clara at home! I&#039;m going to try to be more productive at home instead of solely outside of the house, though! I think that might make me feel better about what I&#039;m spending my energy on.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes! In the beginning I was so thankful that Clara forced me to slow down a bit, but after about 6-7 months I started going a bit nuts (it doesn&#039;t help that it was in the winter and we were trapped inside!). Babies definitely have a way of making us all rethink the way we&#039;re living, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SEE that&#039;s the problem - I don&#039;t leave any time for the &#039;grown up&#039; stuff in my life! I think you&#039;ve identified one of the issues, although I hadn&#039;t really thought about that before. Maybe that&#039;s why it kind of stresses me out that I might be TOO busy. I feel the same way you do, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m definitely not a work-a-holic, but I&#039;m also not very complacent! I do constantly wonder if that can be a bad thing - because I think it&#039;s great to be content in life - but it keeps me doing and trying exciting things!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally understand! Today I came back from a busy weekend and had to sit down and veg in front of the TV so I can get back into it tomorrow! I just can&#039;t have too many days without activity and/or planning or I go crazy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also think I tend to thrive on the adrenaline that accompanies busy-ness but need a balance. I like to have plans and deadlines but if I don&#039;t have any sense of calm I can become overwhelmed and lash out. I&#039;m still learning to balance the two!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree that busyness isn&#039;t bad. I actually kind of go a little nuts if I&#039;m told that I don&#039;t have to do anything that day haha. Like when we&#039;re on vacation, I always need to be doing something. People also tell me I&#039;m a work-a-holic...lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely prefer busyness to having nothing going on. I appreciate a down day every now and again--I usually like to have at least part of one day of the weekend where I don&#039;t have commitments with other people and can take care of my own &quot;life things&quot; (laundry, cleaning, etc. Boring grown up stuff :P ), but when I have too much of that, I feel lazy and blobby. Haha. I like to do things!]]></description>
