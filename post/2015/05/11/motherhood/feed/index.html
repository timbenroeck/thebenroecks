		<description><![CDATA[My priest asked all the moms in the congregation to stand up, and everyone gave us a round of applause. I was sensitive to the fact that there might be those who would have liked to stand, but didn&#039;t. I was happy to hear him later pray for all of those who had lost a child, or a mother. It can be so bittersweet!]]></description>
