		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh so true. I try to remind myself of the sunk cost fallacy in terms of TIME. Like, yes, I may have &#039;wasted&#039; some time, but I&#039;d waste MORE if I continue in a direction - better to just accept that time was wasted and change something than to continue down the same path just because I already started on it - if that makes sense! Did you view it in terms of time or money or everything?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Random but I reminded myself of the sunken cost fallacy ALL THE TIME when I had separated and was figuring out if I needed to get divorced. I basically wrote those phrases over and over in my journal --- &quot;Xyz that I invested is gone, I&#039;m never going to get a &quot;return&quot; at this point, whether we stay together or not. I can&#039;t recoup what was lost in the past, I can only keep from losing more in the future.&quot; If it hadn&#039;t been for the sunken cost fallacy floating around in my brain, I have no idea what I would have done or how I would have coped!! Funny how things you learn in one area of life can pop up and impact the course in other areas...]]></description>
