		<description><![CDATA[I totally feel you, Annie! I feel the same way! However, I do think there are ways to mix up your wardrobe and wear &#039;new&#039; things while not actually having MORE or spending a ton of money - as long as you get rid of things as fast as you bring them in!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this idea! I&#039;ve been trying to cut back on the amount of clothing I own, as I realize it&#039;s just TOO much. I&#039;ve felt like a loner with this idea in a world that is screaming MORE MORE MORE. Thank you for sharing this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok i love this. i mean, i love this a whole lot. 


i&#039;ve been trying out this experiment where i flip the way my clothes are hung around after i wear them. i&#039;m not allowed to repeat until i finish flipping ALMOST everything... it&#039;s been a fun challenge, something i treasure as i get dressed, and made me aware of the reasons i don&#039;t wear clothes -if i never feel pretty or good in them, why do i own them!?! it&#039;s been really eye opening and wonderful and brought me to a point where i&#039;m not hungering for more clothes because i realize how many i really DO have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I&#039;m going to try to avoid the online sites, but I have sold to Twice! I agree about the guessing on sizes thing, I am NOT a fan of that at all. Nothing seems to fit me right if I buy it online. And I agree, I went consignment shopping in Dallas about 10 years ago and I STILL have the dresses and jewelry I bought! And I actually wear them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I honesty thought Chicago only had like 2 consignment stores (because I&#039;m nuts) and then I started noticing them EVERYWHERE. Well, consignment and second-hand stores both. The key to getting rid of things for me is to not actually get rid of them right away, but put them into storage and then take them out in a few months and if you didn&#039;t miss a piece of clothing, then you know it can go!]]></description>
