		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so so so excited for you. You have no idea what&#039;s in store but it&#039;s the best overwhelming and joyous adventure to be on, ever. Honestly, I wish I had fully embraced my new role as a mom and not even had a NOTION of trying to maintain my &#039;old&#039; life. I just think it&#039;s an unrealistic expectation that I put on myself and no one appreciated the effort I was putting into my social plans, including myself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a soon to be momma- I really appreciate reading posts like these. While I&#039;m still obviously a few months away from any of this- I&#039;ve already had the thoughts that I want to try to maintain our same life. And while in some ways, I&#039;m sure we will be able to (at least half of my friends are having babies around the same time- so it will just be more play date and less adult time)- I&#039;ll also need to accept that things will just change! So thanks for this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely never thought I&#039;d let my baby&#039;s schedule dictate what I did socially and now I&#039;m always using Bensen&#039;s bedtime as an excuse to leave places early... But I also got a morning person as a kid, nights are not his forte, so he and Clara would not get along. No midnight playtime for this kid ;) Bedtime routine happens at 8:30 or else he screams bloody murder. And that was all gibberish, I&#039;m pretty sure. Day 3 of Joe being gone this week and I&#039;m starting to lose my sanity I think.... But I loved this post, that is basically what I wanted to say ;)]]></description>
