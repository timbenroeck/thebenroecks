		<description><![CDATA[Yes, so true! I think that paying down debt is a great goal because for the most part we have a lot of control over that, but there are still things that happen to us that could make that goal far more difficult or easier to achieve, and if it&#039;s making us feel like a failure to NOT have accomplished a goal, I think that&#039;s when they become more harmful than good! I love your outlook on life, per usual!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still think that in our 20s a lot of our life goals can change in an instant! I mean, the bigger life goals (like graduating college) is something we have a certain amount of control over, but getting married and having kids (which are goals many of us start having early on!) are certainly harder to predict - and pretending we have control over those things puts a lot of pressure on us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always, you inspire me with your optimistic yet practical outlook on life. I know I tell you this all the time, but any patient who sees you is so freakin&#039; lucky. Right now I&#039;m struggling to not look too far into the future and plan trips and find &#039;bigger&#039; things to look forward to, but I definitely enjoy life more when I take it day by day and focus on what I want to do right now! Trying out a new recipe is a perfect example! And it&#039;s true about finances, too, it&#039;s really hard to have financial goals when there is so much that can happen that is completely beyond our control.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so right about goals needing to be something YOU can control and not depend on other people to complete. AND I think that taking care of debt is a great goal. I mean, things could happen that make it more difficult or easy to achieve, but in general I think that&#039;s an important goal that will definitely lead to a greater since of freedom once it&#039;s accomplished! I love your thoughts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha I don&#039;t even know what I&#039;m going to eat for dinner tomorrow night, much less in a few years! I feel ya :-) And 2020?! That feels so far away for me still! You make such a great point, it&#039;s never a good idea to have goals that are dependent on other people. Love your thoughts. &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel you in so many ways. Honestly, in many ways my life is what I thought it would be as I get nearer and nearer to 30, and in other ways I&#039;m far away from my original life plans. But you&#039;re so right, life CAN and WILL change in an instant and you could wake up tomorrow and embark on a path that&#039;s completely unknown to you tonight!]]></description>
