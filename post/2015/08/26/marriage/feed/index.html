		<description><![CDATA[You said it perfectly! We can&#039;t possibly know what&#039;s going on in any relationship and it&#039;s really none of our business and it&#039;s definitely not our right to judge. I would love to say that anyone who even thinks about cheating is an awful person, but I know that&#039;s not the truth. God hates ALL sin and I can&#039;t judge one person to be a bigger sinner than myself just because their sins are a little more public. It does make me think how embarrassed I&#039;d be if all of my sins were found out by everyone, though - YIKES.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely a pet peeve of mine when people jump on anyone, but especially Christians for being hypocritical. It&#039;s really all about forgiveness and grace and focusing on ourselves!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, it seems like everyone wants to judge everyone else... maybe because it makes them feel better about the things they do wrong in their own relationships? I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good way to approach life!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve taken the thoughts from my head (I can&#039;t say &quot;words from my mouth&quot; because I haven&#039;t really voiced my opinion publicly.) I&#039;ve talked a lot about it with my husband and we are both of the mindset that (1) no one truly knows what goes on inside a marriage and it is no one&#039;s decision but those who are IN the marriage as to whether or not they continue the relationship and  (2) that we should pray for the families affected...because you&#039;re right - everyone sins! Lucky most of us don&#039;t have our sins aired nationally and we can repent and ask for forgiveness privately. 

All in all, it&#039;s just such a sad situation. Some may say that the men &quot;deserve&quot; What they got, but everyone makes mistakes. We can only hope and pray that these people learn from theirs and are made better because of it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the important point you make here is choice. We should be supportive of people&#039;s choices, whether it be to leave or to stay in a marriage. Sometimes it&#039;s the staying that is the easy way out, and support should equally be offered when someone decides to make the tough decision to leave (especially when it is against the social norms presented by their families and religious upbringing). I have strong, personal reasons for saying this, but it ultimately comes down to being loving and supportive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you so much. It is so hard for me to hear and see so many people judging the actions of others in this situation, only because they are a Christian celebrity. Forgiveness can happen and hearts can heal, if you put it in Gods hands. Thank you for posting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is such a powerful post, and I think this is such a good way to approach the subject. Whenever morals come up in the news, it seems like all anyone wants to do is point fingers at the people at the focus - I appreciate that you&#039;re more focused on YOUR life and dealing with YOUR circumstances (and recognizing that your life is not everyone else&#039;s life!) rather than thinking that you&#039;re able to understand everyone else&#039;s circumstances and situations fully. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
