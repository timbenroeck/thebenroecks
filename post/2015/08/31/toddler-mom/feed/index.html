		<description><![CDATA[hahaha can clara and amelia just get together for a hang already, because they would either be best friends immediately, or would terrorize each other immediately. it sounds like they are two peas in a pod right now. we haven&#039;t quite dropped that nap yet, but it&#039;s coming (and tbh I&#039;m terrified). there are lots of big emotions at our house right now, like very very happy and very very upset. no in betweens to be found haha.]]></description>
