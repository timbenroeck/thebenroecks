		<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh, totally been there, done that but I totally bailed out the side door halfway through an arm wave gone awry. How the heck does everyone learn the dance? This was an affirmative blog... maybe you can do some investigative reporting of how to go zero to pro in dance cardio? (it even rhymes!). Have fun the next class, and word to the wise: the back row frequently becomes the front row!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Way to go!! Dancing, in my experience, is something that FREAKS PEOPLE OUT if they think they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing, so A++++ to you for having the courage to go. Honestly, in (almost) three full years of dance, the biggest thing I&#039;ve learned about it is that you have to own whatever you do, even if what you do is wrong. Obviously you&#039;re not performing in front of others, but faking confidence can be a great way to look like you actual are confident in dancing! Anyway, I think it&#039;s awesome that you did this for yourself :)]]></description>
