		<description><![CDATA[I hope she&#039;s back to sleeping through the night soon!!  The needles could be what&#039;s causing her to wake up too though and it *should* be over in a week or so?  Vanessa had her needles this past week too.  We can only hope that&#039;s all it is, right?  
Love the laundry picture, haha, that&#039;s EXACTLY what it&#039;s like around here too.
I also love the minimalism quote.  I&#039;ve been going through a decluttering project and this is good motivation to continue and be more ruthless in my purging than before.  We&#039;ve only been married for two years; how pathetic is it that I have to declutter already!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post makes me feel better. Amelia&#039;s doctor seemed pretty shocked that she wasn&#039;t sleeping through the night yet - his definition is the full 12 hrs. She&#039;s a breastfed 3 month old, for heaven&#039;s sake! Isn&#039;t waking up what babies do?

Hopefully, your little one gets back on track soon!]]></description>
