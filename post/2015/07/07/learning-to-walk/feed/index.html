She is a redhead, isn&#039;t she!  So cute!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So true, she doesn&#039;t feel embarrassment in the least - but that makes me think - why do I feel embarrassment in most situations? When I watch Clara I just feel happy that she&#039;s trying something new, and I&#039;m sure other people around us are rooting for us to succeed more than they&#039;re analyzing why we&#039;re falling short.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I imagine that each discovery that the day brings is exciting for Clara (and you!). How nice that must be to think that everything is new and exciting...Like walking. I do that every day and never give it any wonder. I don&#039;t have children, but this was just the push I needed during a frustrating week. Even if I get a bit off track, I am making progress!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, goodness gracious, look at that hair! What a cutie! I love the thought behind this message - &quot;failing&quot; without the usual negative connotation we associate with that word. I&#039;m sure that kind of attitude is much easier to maintain if you have no concept of embarrassment, but even just being able to put a positive spin on not succeeding could have such a helpful difference, I think.]]></description>
