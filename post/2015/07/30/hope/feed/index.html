		<description><![CDATA[We should never lose hope, we just need patience and faith in God. Failures and problems are just challenges in life. We are given challenges to strengthen us and our faith in God. We are not given challenges that we cannot survive, we should learn how to stand up after downfall because there is always another day, another chances. These are just the tools to keep us going and the reason why we are fighting for our  goals. We just need to trust God&#039;s plan for us because He knows what is best for us. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchwritingkings.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper writing service reviews&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you referring to the New Yorker article about the earthquake that will destroy Seattle and everything west of I5?! Because I don&#039;t even live there and I found it terrifying. Although, I read some comments on Reddit about it and felt much better. I love the outlook you&#039;re choosing, though, worry never serves a positive purpose and it just reminds us that we need to rely on God more! (Easier said than done, though.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I needed to hear this today, so thank you for sharing. I&#039;ve been feeling incredibly anxious this week, for various reasons. Part of it has had to do with a certain NYT article making the rounds on Facebook reminding me that the place I live is supposed to fall into the ocean. People love sharing this fear, but I have yet to see any hopeful responses. I&#039;ve also been fearful of the way rent has been rising without a rising income to match in my city, worrying about how it will impact me when my lease is up in September. This worry does not serve me. It does not serve me to wonder whether I should move to a safer city with more affordable housing. I love where I live, and I grew up here. This place is mine. And I am hopeful that it will remain a wonderful place. Here&#039;s to hope.]]></description>
