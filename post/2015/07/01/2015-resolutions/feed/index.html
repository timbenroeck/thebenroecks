		<description><![CDATA[Fantastic resolutions that you have there.  I&#039;m not sure that I made any this year (I certainly can&#039;t remember them, anyway).  Your list is inspiring in and of itself though so I think I might make some &quot;Rest of 2015 Resolutions&quot; very soon.  I may steal several of yours too. ;)  Sounds like you&#039;re doing great!  Keep it up!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love how much success you&#039;re having in so many areas of your life! You continue to encourage and inspire me :-)  Do you think you were getting migraines because of stress and overwhelming feelings? Tim suffers from chronic migraines and it is the worst, but he can&#039;t figure out why he keeps getting them (and of course he isn&#039;t the best at remembering what went on that day that could trigger it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES. I&#039;m a bit of a control freak so the thought of &#039;life just happening&#039; to me is terrifying in itself! But I am trying to spend my time wisely, and so far it&#039;s going pretty well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh that&#039;s such a good idea! I can&#039;t remember the last time Tim and I ate at the table phone-free, or just in general, really! I want to keep phones out of the bedroom, but I think that may be a lost cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to hear that so many of these things are working out well and so helpful to you!!! It also seems like a lot of things that you&#039;re doing are kind of steps to the other things you want to do -- like, being in a routine of cooking at home makes it so much easier to entertain people (for me, it also makes it easier to keep the house clean, because it keeps me in the habit of at least looking around the kitchen and picking things up, instead of just completely ignoring my environment!!).


My resolution was to be more mindful and respectful of my own personal needs. Oh, my gosh. Enormous success. I still have room for improvement (especially when it comes to stepping back before or during time with patients, to make sure I&#039;ve sorted through my own business and can effectively communicate and make the most of my short time with patients -- which is a bigger and bigger issue, because my patient load keeps increasing which means shorter appointments &#062;_&#060;). 


But in my personal life, it&#039;s been a complete and total transformation. I used to get horrible migraine headaches constantly. This year, I&#039;ve barely had any... For the first time, I&#039;m figuring out what&#039;s going on with myself and taking action before my whole system goes haywire - even communicating what I need to other people, and recognizing when others are disrespecting or trying to control me by invalidating my needs (also newly appreciating people who don&#039;t treat me that way, and deliberately avoiding any tendency to treat other people that way). My entire way of relating to the world is completely restructured. Such a huge change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the word &quot;intentional&quot;, I&#039;ve been meditating a lot on that specific word this year too. For me it has been really important to be intentional in my goals, choices and actions rather than allowing life to just &quot;happen to me&quot;. Sounds like you&#039;ve been very intentional so far!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like you&#039;re doing great! I think being more intentional is one of the biggest challenges. Andrew and I started eating dinner at the table or kitchen bar with no phones or TV and it took a few weeks but it&#039;s not as tough now to get used to it]]></description>
