		<description><![CDATA[Yay for new bikes! I actually don&#039;t ride with Clara on my bike, I let Tim do that! He&#039;s used to riding a motorcycle with a passenger, so I figured the shifting weight wouldn&#039;t bother him. He said it wasn&#039;t hard at all, though. Clara does get fussy after about 4 miles, but I think she enjoys it overall! How did the ride around your neighborhood with your girls go?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful weekend!!! We actually just bought bikes last night for our family of four! Well, my husband and I got bikes and we also got two child attachment seats for our girls. Is it hard to ride with Clara attached to your bike? We went for an 8-mile ride this am (just us, the girls were at daycare) and I&#039;m not sure how I&#039;m going to do it with a baby attached!!! Does Clara enjoy being in the seat or does she get fussy? Tonight we&#039;re attaching the seats and going to cruise around our neighborhood. Hoping it goes well!! I love that you guys bike to the farmer&#039;s mkt :) So fun!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anything that involves s&#039;mores sounds like a great way to spend the weekend to me :) It looks like Millennium Park was packed for the concert! I was actually at a free show there on Thursday to kick off my holiday weekend, and it&#039;s one of my favorite things to do during the summer in Chicago. Free music, the skyline, food - what more could you ask for?]]></description>
