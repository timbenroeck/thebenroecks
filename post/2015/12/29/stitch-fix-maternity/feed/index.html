		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Val! I definitely am not great at fashion, especially when it comes to maternity stuff. My first pregnancy I wore non-maternity stuff for way too long... this time around I&#039;m trying to embrace my growing bump and wear more comfy clothes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those items look so great on you-- no wonder you kept it all!  Those are the perfect reasons to order yourself a fix...and it seems to work because you get such great stuff!  My favorite on you is the Loveappella striped top- I&#039;m a sucker for stripes and mustard too!  And I love that brand..I&#039;ve kept a few things from them as well!]]></description>
