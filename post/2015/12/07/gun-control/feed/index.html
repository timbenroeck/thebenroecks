		<description><![CDATA[Hear hear!
I&#039;m in Canada and we have gun control laws - no one complains about them, even people like me who would consider themselves more on the conservative side. The first time I was in a US Walmart and I saw a glass box full of guns and ammunition, I was SHOCKED.  I don&#039;t even know where I would get a gun if I wanted one, and I like it that way.  Several relatives of mine hunt and so obviously have hunting guns, but why anyone (other than those in the police force) would ever need an assault weapon is beyond me. 
Bulletproof blankets for kids have to be the most sad invention ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You bring up such a great point about mental health. It is really bad that as soon as some horrible mass shooting happen we all wait for the &#039;oh they had mental problems that were diagnosed and ignored or even undiagnosed&#039; OR &#039;oh they were radicalized&#039;. I mean, I would argue that no one SANE goes around killing people, but that doesn&#039;t mean that every person who does is crazy and of course we can&#039;t discriminate against people with mental health problems and treat them like second-class citizens. That in itself is a whole dilemma! But I will forever be in favor of more people getting help for mental health problems. When living in big city where homeless people seem to be everywhere, it&#039;s so apparent to me that we&#039;re ignoring big areas of needs in our country.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh I definitely don&#039;t have solutions, I just want us to try SOMETHING as a nation to show that we&#039;re standing against gun violence. I totally agree with what you say here. We have guns in our house and I wouldn&#039;t want someone to take them away from us... but honestly, I would give up our rights as gun owners if it meant tighter control on who was able to have them. For us they&#039;re used as a part of a hobby, and they&#039;re just not that important.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did see that Twitter timeline.. I think that&#039;s where I also saw all of the politicians who voted against banning people on the terror watch list from buying guns. Just ridiculous. And you make an excellent point about Republicans wanting to regulate everything EXCEPT guns. I just don&#039;t get it at all. If banning things doesn&#039;t work, we should probably stop the whole abortion discussion entirely, because that one in particular really exhausts me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that you mentioned alcohol as something that is legal but we still have strict control over. I mean, you have to be a certain age to buy it, to drink it... some states have restrictions on the types of stores that can sell it and the days of the week it can be purchased and all bars are supposed to stop selling to someone who is clearly too drunk. It&#039;s crazy we have more regulations on alcohol than guns! (Maybe that isn&#039;t true, but it feels that way to me.)


Also, I swear I heard Mike Huckabee say (on The View) that if someone breaks into your house with an assault weapon, the person defending the house should have an assault-style weapon to defend themselves. WHAT?! I now need to worry about people breaking into my house with a military grade weapon and the only way to defend myself is to have a BIGGER GUN than they do?! I really should ensure that&#039;s what he said, but I swear he did.]]></description>
