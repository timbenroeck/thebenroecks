		<description><![CDATA[I saw a tweet from you that said you&#039;re cleaning out your closet using the KonMari method! Yay! I love that. My problem is that I love cleaning out my closet (and definitely loved that method) but then wouldn&#039;t know what to exactly buy and I would end up with a lot of random stuff at the end of the day. I&#039;m getting better, though!]]></description>
