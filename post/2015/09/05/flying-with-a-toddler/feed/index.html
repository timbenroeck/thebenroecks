		<description><![CDATA[Oh you can TOTALLY do it! At least your kids are old enough to entertain themselves or watch movies if they need to :-) It&#039;s definitely a bit overwhelming to fly with a toddler but I refuse to stop traveling at this stage and roadtrips seem even more difficult because they&#039;re way longer! So I guess I&#039;m hoping she gets used to airplanes for now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahahahaha! I&#039;m glad I can offer all perspectives ;-) Luckily Clara really doesn&#039;t scream very much, she just yells a lot. (I define screaming as crying whereas she just yells at us because we aren&#039;t paying enough attention to her or giving her the &#039;right&#039; kind of crackers.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES, sleeping babies are the cutest and sweetest. I could watch Clara sleep all day. I mean, I like her when she&#039;s awake, too, but only if she isn&#039;t yelling at me  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha GOOD. And the flight back was a bit easier (because it wasn&#039;t over naptime) so there&#039;s hope!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww, there&#039;s just nothing sweeter than a sleeping baby!  :)  I can&#039;t even imagine taking my one year old on a plane.  No judgement from me on the ice cube thing!  A momma&#039;s gotta do what a momma&#039;s gotta do!  (I&#039;m sure the other passengers appreciated the distraction from screaming too! ;) )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My kids are older, 4 and 6, but I still haven&#039;t been brave enough to take them on an airplane! I just get so anxious thinking about it. Kudos to you for doing what you need to do. You&#039;re right - saying no in that situation is just pointless. Might as well let her be entertained! :)]]></description>
