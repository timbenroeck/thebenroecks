		<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re actually not having a conference in 2016, but instead are doing two regional one-day events in July and November, with the dates and locations TBD. It&#039;s a bummer they aren&#039;t having the big event in Indy, though, it was so much fun! I recommend joining the network even if you don&#039;t go to the conferences, though! I love the classes (you get one free class per month with the $10 membership) and there&#039;s a pretty good sense of community on the website through forums. I&#039;ve met a bunch of women through my community group and we pray for each other and encourage each other regularly - which is pretty neat! If you decide to sign up, my referral link is: http://bit.ly/1VjI50Z.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are such an encouragement (per usual) to me, Jordyn! I think it was also really nice for me to realize that I can leave Clara and she&#039;s fine when I return! I mean, I knew she would be, but now I feel really confident about it... even though she no longer sleeps and it&#039;s driving me NUTS to need to sleep &#039;train&#039; her again! I don&#039;t know how nanny&#039;s do it... it&#039;s tough enough to watch my own kid and I can&#039;t imagine watching someone else&#039;s!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year was actually the last one! Now they&#039;re going to do 2 regional events per year instead of one big event. And I&#039;m sorry to hear about Caleb&#039;s sleep! It&#039;s amazing how any sort of change really messes them up, but at least he&#039;s only up once now! Clara is still waking up around every half hour after 3am and Tim and I are SUFFERING.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohmygosh, really?! I wish I would have known that so I could have tried to find her - even though it was really crazy there. It was truly SUCH a great weekend and I could feel God&#039;s love radiating through every individual I talked to. Does Christine have a blog or online store or anything?]]></description>
