		<description><![CDATA[I buy mine from local stores, as well! I had heard about peppermint oil for headaches and lavender on pillows, but I&#039;ve never tried it myself! Do you add peppermint oil directly to your temples or do you mix it with coconut oil first? I&#039;m such a newbie! Also, I&#039;m keeping this tea tree oil in mind for my skin because I have some and have no idea what to do with it! Right now eucalyptus oil is in my diffuser because even though we aren&#039;t sick I&#039;m convinced the rest of the world is and I don&#039;t want that nonsense in my house!

Thanks for the great tips!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I keep hearing about Thieves oil from everyone! I really need to try this, I think. And I totally hear you on the expenses thing, I was really hesitant to buy any, but with the diffuser I use  them often and at least my house smells great, if nothing else!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone keeps talking about Thieves oil and I haven&#039;t bought it yet! Is it only sold through Young Living? I definitely use coconut oil on Clara (especially for diaper rash) but have debated putting lavender in it, too... but I&#039;m nervous to! Anything to get her to sleep through the night, though! I&#039;ll keep you posted and you let me know if you try it out, too! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i use essential oils just with diffusers right now (we have an oil only diffuser from young living). i mostly use thieves oil, especially in the winter to freshen/disinfect the air in the house when we can&#039;t open windows. i just started trying lemon oil in my water bottle as an energizer...but i feel like that might work better for decently rested people haha. i always hesitate to use oils on babies, just because their skin is so sensitive. i did work with a teacher at an ECFE class i used to take amelia to who was a PhD in child development, and she did say that plain delivery oils were safest, because even lavender could be irritating to some babies. she said that coconut oil is cooling, so it&#039;s best used during hot weather, while grapeseed and jojoba oils were best for everyday use. that being said, i have a TON of family members who swear by putting oils on their babies, from lavender for sleeping to thieves for colds. i&#039;m all for the natural stuff, so really, it can&#039;t hurt to try. and especially as the little ones get older, i get so much more comfortable trying new things with them...i&#039;m definitely tempted to use the lavender trick for amelia at night if her sleep doesn&#039;t get better when her teething is on a break! you&#039;ll have to update us for sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mind if I ask why you stopped using tea tree oil on your face? I&#039;m pregnant, and my face is breaking out so bad and has turned super oily. I&#039;ve seen several people suggest the tea tree oil, but I&#039;m not sure about pregnant people using it. I&#039;ve got to find something because it&#039;s way worse than when I was a teenager.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A 60 something year old man I worked with uses essential oils daily. He mainly uses thieves especially at work as a disinfectant. He would toss a tiny drop or two in his mouth as well as spray the computer keyboards and mouses and things because we all had to share computer stations. He said he hasn&#039;t been sick in years since he started using the oils. A fun tidbit of info he gave me: thieves is a mixture of several different oils and is named thieves because people would rub it on themselves before they would rob victims of the bubonic plague back in the day, and they wouldn&#039;t get sick from being in contact with them. I&#039;ve been interested in using them especially for allergy relief but have yet to buy any. I think I&#039;m afraid of shelling out the money and them not working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We use them, but we havent diffused them. One of my friends diffuses lavender in her babies room every night and swears that helps him sleep better. I use lavender on my pillow at night when I am restless/anxious/cant sleep. We also put a couple drops of peppermint oil directly on our skin (THE HORRORS) when we have headaches, and have done the same with Eucalyptus oil when we were sick to help us breathe. Peppermint oil does seem to take away headaches for both Ronnie and I. I also used to use tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil on my face and the tea tree really seems to clear up blemishes FAST. I love it. Also, finally, Ronnie has used Clove Oil directly on a tooth that was hurting and swears by it. I too have always been skeptical about the &quot;healing powers&quot; of them, but those are the few we have actually used and have worked for us. We buy them at a natural grocer store here instead of through a company like DoTerra or Young Living or whatever that super popular direct sales company is.]]></description>
