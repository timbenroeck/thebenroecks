		<description><![CDATA[Ha... well, take a French course has been on there for years but I&#039;m terrible at going for it. I took high school French for years so I know the basics, but I&#039;d be lost in conversation. I would also like to take a calligraphy course; there are so many of those touring around nowadays. I could go on and on, but I think I should try to accomplish those two before adding any others to the pile!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Anna! I agree, investing in myself is more important than I allowed myself to acknowledge, and I&#039;m glad I have the opportunity to change that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! I never really thought of it that way... that learning can actually add value to others, but I totally agree! You should definitely take a photography class, I kind of thought I knew what I was doing and I&#039;ve been proved VERY wrong after just a few classes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugghhh I&#039;ve been in quite a few jobs I just wasn&#039;t passionate about, and I&#039;m still attempting to find that perfect fit! I definitely think (like you) I ended up in my jobs out of fear of not finding anything better - so I&#039;m glad you&#039;re going to be doing something different! And yay for still being able to work from home - that sounds amazing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good for you! Learning is a wonderful investment in ourselves that often benefits others as well. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re investing in yourself and letting God guide you as you navigate new and old roles in your life.
