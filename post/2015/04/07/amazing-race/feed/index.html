		<description><![CDATA[this was cute! a perk of reality tv - who knew :P
but i agree - especially with communication! My GOODNESS so many petty arguments have been over just not being clear with each other.

I like your &quot;Don&#039;t be afraid to try new things and embrace the unknown&quot; - this is definitely something I will take and run with.  We are a bit stuck in the same/same at the moment and need something to do &#039;together&#039; thats new and out of our routines!]]></description>
