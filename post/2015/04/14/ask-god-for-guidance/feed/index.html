		<description><![CDATA[Awwww this is such a pretty version of this song! And thanks for the kind words :-) I&#039;m lucky to have the luxury of time and resources to really investigate what I might be interested in - so I&#039;m trying to take advantage of the opportunity!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! Exactly, without praying about it I just kind of wander from thing to thing, without feeling any real sense of fulfillment - but I&#039;m working on that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES.  in sync with what i need to be doing more of!  Trusting God much much more than I am in the everyday and for direction.  not trying to figure it out in my own time or own capacity....cause invariably i&#039;m ending up the same - halfheartedly looking into things without any follow through.  Great post lovely lady! 
and yes - yes you should try for another baby....everyone needs a sister or brother :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are such a wonderful person with so much to give the world. I think it&#039;s very wise to take the time to figure out what that might look like, and how to keep things balanced and healthy. That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to work on myself, this week... wishing I could just dive in (and fit in), but knowing I need to take more space, be deliberate and be true to my own unique self ;-)
