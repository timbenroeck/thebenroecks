		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jennifer! I totally agree - I used to think &#039;yeah, I know time will go by fast. All parents say that. Whatever.&#039; but now I realize how true it really is! I feel like there&#039;s a milestone every single day at this age and years are starting to go by quickly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful post Lisa Marie! 


I used to hate when people would tell me that time would fly by but they were right. I think our gauge changes when we have kids. There are definitive milestones, birthdays, and growth which we witness constantly. We can&#039;t ignore the passage of time when we have kids. 


Thanks for sharing (and for linking up to the #SHINEbloghop).


Wishing you a lovely day.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow this was awesome and not full of any cliches and quite honestly, super eye opening. I don&#039;t have kids yet but I would say I really wasn&#039;t aware of at least 75% of the things you mentioned above. Thanks for such a heartfelt post that will probably prepare me for when my mom-time comes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that it&#039;s strange that people don&#039;t know what to do with pregnant/new parent friends. I think they assume that parents don&#039;t want to socialize anymore, which couldn&#039;t be further from the truth! But it is a true blessing that I&#039;ve met so many moms I can relate to :-)]]></description>
