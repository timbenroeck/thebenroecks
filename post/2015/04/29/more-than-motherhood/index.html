						<p>I had this moment a few weeks ago in which I realized that<strong> I don&#8217;t think being a mom is the only thing that God has planned for me.</strong> While this may seem rather obvious, to me, it was a revelation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5557" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-5.jpg" alt="God is calling me to more than motherhood." width="650" height="975" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-5.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-5-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>When I got pregnant with Clara super-quickly, I decided at that moment that God wanted nothing more from me than to be a mom. Tim and I had prayed diligently about becoming parents, and I thought that God&#8217;s swiftness in answering this prayer was also an instruction to me to prepare to lay down everything to become a mother &#8211; because clearly if He answered us so directly, that must have been His will for me, right? Isn&#8217;t being a mother all about sacrifice? I thought the answer was (of course) <strong>YES!</strong></p>
<p>I decided to quit my job (no big sacrifice, because I wasn&#8217;t enjoying it) to stay at home with Clara, and I put all of my life plans on hold to reinvest myself in everything &#8216;mom&#8217;.</p>
<p>For the first six months, I actually think I did a pretty good job at being a mom. I loved the newborn stage. I cherished every second with Clara and I responded to every whimper and cry, all night and all day. Then Clara became mobile and very demanding &#8211;<em> as soon as I turn my back she&#8217;s chewing a cord!</em> &#8211; And at around that time I decided I needed to get the heck out of the house more frequently. It&#8217;s not like I never left the house without Clara, Tim has always been a super-dad (in my very biased opinion) and I started leaving Clara with him for a few hours at a time when she was only a couple of weeks old. We started date nights when she was around 2 months old, so she was also used to being with family members other than me. However, when she was around six months old I started needing some &#8216;serious&#8217; time away &#8211; meaning for more than 3-4 hours at a time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5556" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-4.jpg" alt="God is calling me to more than motherhood." width="650" height="975" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-4.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><strong>To preserve my sanity and to feel like I was doing something useful, I followed a nudge I felt in my heart to volunteer, and I began regularly volunteering (two days a week) to prepare tax returns for low income families in Chicago.</strong> I absolutely loved volunteering and I loved using some of my skills to give back to people! My energy returned and from there my plans for life started churning again. You see, when I was stuck in my house <em>(yay Chicago winter with a tiny baby)</em> it became impossible for me to plan what I wanted to do with my life. I felt stuck. I felt lost. I felt bored. I knew that I had a lot to offer and the world had a lot to offer me, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how I could accomplish anything at all since my number one priority and calling was a little baby who needed me &#8211; physically, emotionally, and mentally.</p>
<p><em><strong>How could I maintain a sense of self while also being a mom?!</strong></em></p>
<p>And then I realized: God gave me this baby because He called me to be a mom, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I need to <em>only</em> be a mom, and it doesn&#8217;t even mean that I&#8217;m best equipped to be a mom. There might be other things that I&#8217;m going to be better at and that will actually advance His kingdom more than I will be able to as a mom.<br />
<strong>My mind was honestly blown when I thought about this, and I truly think it was God speaking peace and wisdom into my heart.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, He has given me Clara to watch over here on Earth. She is without a doubt the most precious gift I&#8217;ve ever been given. However, I am more than her mother, and that is okay.</p>
<p>I do not need to, nor should I, sacrifice everything I want to do to be &#8216;only&#8217; a mom.<br />
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m taking my own interests so seriously.</p>
<p>&#8230; I&#8217;m going to physical therapy to work hard to get my body back &#8211; because I don&#8217;t believe that I should need to sacrifice my body forever because I had a baby. Yes, the c-section scar will remain and is actually something I&#8217;m proud of, but I&#8217;m not accepting that split abs and bad posture are a simple side effect of a &#8216;burden&#8217; I bore! I&#8217;m going to fix this, darnit, even if it takes time away from my baby.<br />
&#8230; I&#8217;m also going to continue going to counseling to work on some difficult relationships in my life.<br />
&#8230; I&#8217;m going to read because I love reading and I find great peace and joy in this hobby.<br />
&#8230; I&#8217;m going to blog because I love reaching out to others and I hope my writing encourages someone out there.<br />
&#8230; I&#8217;m taking classes on photography and eventually piano because I want to get better at these skills.<br />
&#8230; I&#8217;ll continue to travel every chance I get because it&#8217;s important for me to see the world, and Clara will come along because I like to have my whole family together.<br />
&#8230; I will eventually embark on a different sort of job path because I am not meant to sit at home and think of crafts and activities all day. Some moms are gifted at entertaining small children &#8211; but I am not. I am better at working with adults, and I think adults are who I&#8217;m supposed to be discipling and sharing my gifts with.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5554" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-2.jpg" alt="God is calling me to more than motherhood." width="650" height="975" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-2.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150412-clara-jane-2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><strong>This is not to say that I am not and will never be a good mom &#8211; on the contrary, I think I&#8217;m a great mom and I know I&#8217;ll only get better.</strong> I recognize that some parts of motherhood are going to be challenging to me, but I feel I&#8217;m well-equipped and will be even better equipped with some more experience and prayers. However, I know myself well enough to understand that although I&#8217;ll be a fantastic mom to Clara (and subsequent children, God willing!), being a mom is not where I&#8217;m going to find the most self-fulfillment each and every day.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m spreading my wings with a new determination and courage and am asking God what He wants me to do in addition to this role He has bestowed upon me.</p>
<p>I think He has some great things in store for me, and I&#8217;m very intentionally attempting to follow His lead.<br />
<strong>I truly think some women have a specific call to motherhood and they feel completely content at home with children <em>(what a gift this is!)</em> &#8211; but I am not one of those women &#8211; and I&#8217;m okay with that.</strong></p>
