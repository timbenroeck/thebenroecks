		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading your post, and happy I found your blog in the oak &#038; oats link up. So much of what you wrote speaks to me also, and I appreciate that you did it in such a non-judgmental way. Way to go mama!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[we don&#039;t have kids yet but this has been something so important on my heart lately as we try for them. I know that motherhood will take up a portion of my life while they are young but I know that it&#039;s not the only calling God has given me! thank you for writing this!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohmygoodness, good for you for reaching out to have some &#039;adult&#039; time! It can take a lot of courage to ask a new friend on a mom-date sans kids! I hope you have the best time :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the kind words, Monica! I had the same reservations when Tim and I were praying about starting a family - I wasn&#039;t sure I wanted to give up everything to become a mom. BUT, that&#039;s why this revelation was so freeing to me - God didn&#039;t call me to give up everything! Yes, being a mom is consuming, but it isn&#039;t ALL-CONSUMING. Good luck and blessings for this new life transition you&#039;re preparing to embark on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Beth! So true, He does call us to be so many things and it&#039;s not always apparent immediately why, but it all works together to accomplish more for His kingdom!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! This is so true, I wish that I completely trusted God immediately, but sometimes I catch myself really questioning if He knows what He&#039;s doing - haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son is just about 8 months now, and I feel similar stirrings in my heart. In fact,  I randomly messaged a mom I had made acquaintance with at church to go out for a &quot;friend date&quot;....without kids! This was a big move for me, and I am so excited for it. I&#039;ve started going to the gym again too. I love being a full time mom, but I am cherishing these breaks when I&#039;m not always on baby mode. Thanks for the write up :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is such a lovely and encouraging post! (And your daughter is adorable!) My husband and I are praying about starting a family these days and I have had this fear that once I become a mom then that&#039;s the only thing that I will be doing. However, as you have said - God has a plan and there are so many different ways that He will use us to serve Him. It will be exciting to see exactly what that will entail and I know that whatever he calls me to, that he will prepare my heart for it :)]]></description>
