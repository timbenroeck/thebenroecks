		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think wearing makeup sends the wrong message unless you make comments about how you NEED it to look pretty or if you won&#039;t leave home without it. I think makeup can be fun and artistic - it&#039;s like playing dress up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with you about how hard it is to eat quickly and healthfully. I rarely have the energy to make a great meal after a day of watching just ONE kid, so I can imagine how exhausted you are at the end of the day! My goal is to try to be better with preparing snacks and meals ahead of time (maybe even use my crock pot!) but it&#039;s seriously something I struggle with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This made me tear up, because this has been on my mind a lot lately as well. My husband and I had already sifted through our music and television choices. But, I really struggle with the food part. We have 3 boys under the age of 5, and with my husband in the military, I&#039;m often just trying to make quick meals. Unfortunately, those quick meals aren&#039;t exactly the most healthy. I really need to buckle down and come up with healthier food options for our family. I would love for my children to grow up enjoying fruits and veggies and not being picky eaters. I found you on the &quot;Let&#039;s Be Friends&quot; Blog Hop and am now a new follower!

		<description><![CDATA[This has been on my mind recently too.  Vanessa watches with great interest as I put my makeup on in the morning and it makes me wonder if maybe not now but eventually she&#039;ll think she needs it to be beautiful... having a child is probably the best motivator for living intentionally.  I always enjoy reading your intentional posts.  :)

I&#039;d also love to win the free download.  ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha! I love that story about your mom! We can&#039;t really watch too much TV with Clara in the room because we have our cable box too low and she loves hitting all of the buttons - which creates a horrible TV watching experience! But, it&#039;s probably for the best because I honestly think she picks up SO MUCH and I&#039;d rather it not be Judge Judy rantings...!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i would have commented without the giveaway, because i&#039;ve been thinking about this same thing a lot lately. now that amelia is picking up on more and more, i find myself questioning if having that trashy tv show with the yelling on it in the background is really the best. i am slowly starting to be more aware of what i listen to in the car too...hence the podcast obsession, for when there is nothing on the radio. i love how thoughtful you are as a mom. (funny sidenote: my mom used to watch soaps when we were little since she stayed home and there was no hulu or netflix, and she said she stopped when i started to ask why the people were yelling so much...she was like, woops!)]]></description>
