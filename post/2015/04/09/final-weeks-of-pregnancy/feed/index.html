		<description><![CDATA[SO MANY THINGS TO DO, but I promise, most of it doesn&#039;t matter and you&#039;ll find time later to get the unimportant stuff done, even if it&#039;s after the baby arrives! The baby/kid related stuff never ends!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wise words of wisdom until you&#039;re 2 weeks away and you are on maternity leave. I had all kinds of ants in my pants! If we ever have a #2 - I&#039;ll definitely do things a lot differently!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha, is it awful that I really want to do this and I can&#039;t!?!?!? I didn&#039;t really set myself up for success on this one.... you know, with my due date falling the week after finals. Luckily, there is a lot less due at school these last few weeks (I&#039;ve been able to get away with one solid night of homework this week, and next week I think I&#039;ll need two or three tops) and my house is pretty clean. There&#039;s just still the predicament that the baby&#039;s room isn&#039;t done, and we&#039;re still fairly packed... a year after we bought our house. oh, and then there&#039;s the issue that Amberly doesn&#039;t know how to relax!!!!! jk. I&#039;m trying hard. I&#039;ve been sitting more, and doing more fun things with Joe, and I&#039;m planning lots of fun pedicures/lunches/shopping fun for when I start working from home and my schedule is more flexible. And I&#039;m trying to take a long bath twice a week and just do things that I can enjoy for a long time without a baby crying and interrupting. And yep... I love this advice though, I&#039;ll be sharing it and taking it to heart as much as possible... as I&#039;m doing projects every night... hee hee.]]></description>
