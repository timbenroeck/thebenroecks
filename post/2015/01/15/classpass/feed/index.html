		<description><![CDATA[Yes! I really liked Eb &#038; Flow, and liked the class I took at Barre Code more than I expected. Core Power wasn&#039;t in ClassPass&#039;s network when I was a member, but if you get the chance, Elyse is my FAVE. She teaches at both Uptown and Lakeview. I can&#039;t say enough good things about her and definitely recommend one of her classes if it works for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will definitely let you know! So far I&#039;ve been to Pure Barre, Dailey Method, Yoga Six, Bare Feet Yoga, and Corepower. I think I&#039;ll definitely go back to all of them, and I&#039;m also excited to try Eb &#038; Flow and maybe Barre Code (I think you reviewed both of those?!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big fan of Pure Barre, too, but it was definitely costing me quite a bit of money to go to their classes. Look into ClassPass for sure! If you use one of the links in this post you can get $50 back when you sign up, which I wish was an option when I signed up a month ago! Oh well :-)]]></description>
