		<description><![CDATA[Ooo that latte creamer seems neat!! I drink iced coffee...I wonder if it would work haha!

I&#039;m also desperately trying to become a morning person. My baby usually wakes around 4...and I could just get up after feeding her but it&#039;s so, so hard haha. I&#039;m about to become a SAHM (just put in my two weeks at work!), so I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll get up early three mornings per week!!

Hope you are doing well!

		<description><![CDATA[That creamer is really cool....
I don&#039;t like sugar in my coffee, but I love cream. I&#039;ve actually started making London fogs/tea lattes at home with my milk frother, honey, milk, and some vanilla :)
(I am SO NOT a morning person. Ugh.)]]></description>
