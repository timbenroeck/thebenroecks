		<description><![CDATA[I totally get it. I&#039;m in the trenches too but I&#039;m starting to see the light! I&#039;ve found that writing in my planner has helped me to stay organized and to not expect myself to accomplish 80 things per day. Now I just write one or two tasks down and leave the rest for later! Also, getting up earlier than the kids is the WORST and I know I&#039;m supposed to do it but I&#039;d rather just stay up an hour later.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It makes such a huge difference! Sometimes I really have to remind myself how important self-care is, especially when I&#039;m too tired and I just don&#039;t feel like taking care of myself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Heather!! I&#039;m so glad you can relate, because it reminds me I&#039;m not the only one not able to manage this super-well! I agree, some days I feel so busy and then I realize that &#039;busy&#039; meant I washed the floor a bijillion times and had no time for anything else. Bleh!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this. I feel totally the same way, even though I&#039;m not at home with my girls during the day. Being a mother to small children is sooo rewarding but can also be so tiring and &quot;busy&quot;. By that I mean, yes, it feels busy cleaning the floor 18 times a day. It&#039;s great to be able to acknowledge the things that still make you feel like you and make you feel happy. Even if you hit one or two of those things every day, that&#039;s great! :) Glad you had a rejuvenating and good weekend!!]]></description>
