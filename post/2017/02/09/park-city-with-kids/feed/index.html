		<description><![CDATA[I love hearing how you make things like this work and what your struggles were because I&#039;m always in awe of how adventurous you are, even with kids. I haven&#039;t ventured out of the house with both of them by myself, and we have only gone 45 minutes away from home once. Next time you come back to Utah, I&#039;ll show you all the greatest parts of Salt Lake!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, the sleeping part sounds rough!! Utah is amazing though :) There are some really spectacular places and houses to rent in the Mt. Hood / Mt. Bachelor area near Bend - which is also amaaaazing, but it&#039;s a brewery and distillery type town (although, amazing restaurants for brunch and every other meal!!), may be an adult trip but you can take a super short flight to bend and it&#039;s a great area!]]></description>
