		<description><![CDATA[REALLY?! That&#039;s so fun! Did they just go to Diablo Lake and head back to Seattle?! Definitely worth the day trip - the water is this INCREDIBLE color. And I would have to agree, the PNW is the most beautiful area of America. Not that I&#039;m biased or anything. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No way! My family was just there this past weekend! My dad, mom and sister had gone out to visit my grandparents who live in the Seattle area, and they did this as a day trip on Saturday. My mom&#039;s profile picture on Facebook now is actually at the exact same spot as the second picture in this post! What are the chances! Anyway, I said it to my family, and I&#039;ll say it again here: that whole area looks SO beautiful. The PNW, as far as I&#039;m concerned, is the most gorgeous place in the whole country.]]></description>
