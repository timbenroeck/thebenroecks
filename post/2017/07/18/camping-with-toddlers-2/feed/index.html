		<description><![CDATA[I actually think hiking is harder than camping! At least camping they&#039;re perfectly entertained playing in dirt and we don&#039;t need to move them anywhere and deal with a lot of whining about walking and sun and snacks... Just today I was considering trying to take both girls on a 3 mile hike by myself and thought &quot;NOPE&quot; I just can&#039;t do it. Send me all tips for hiking with reluctant toddlers!!! (We go hiking, but usually Tim carries Clara for most of it.)]]></description>
