		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha YES! We&#039;re having such an easy time getting both kids to sleep now, but Isabelle wakes up like three times per night (for just a few minutes if we go in and pat her back) and sometimes Clara will randomly wake up, but thankfully that&#039;s getting more rare. It&#039;s all just such a sh*t show over here but I agree that an early bedtime is SAVING MY SANITY. Plus, when the kids go to bed earlier, I go to bed earlier, too! More sleep for everyone! 

Thanks for the encouragement, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one struggling with toddler sleep!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also have non sleepers. Three of them. My oldest two (5 and 3) finally are a bit more consistent with sleeping through the night, but my 9-month-old wakes like four times still. I feel for every parent out there who hasn&#039;t slept in five years LOL!

Definitely stick with the early bedtimes!!! That is my saving grace. Our kids all go to bed at 6:30pm. We try to start the routine at 6:15 and keep it super short. PJ&#039;s (a bath is given at like 5pm so it&#039;s out of the way, and we only bathe them like twice a week hahaha), story, brush teeth, cuddle/tuck in, bed. My middle one is the one who always needs something for a solid 30 minutes, but she&#039;s asleep by 7pm most nights. Keep it quick and be strict!!!!! Now if only I could figure out how to get them to STAY asleep lol!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am HORRIBLE at routines. I don&#039;t do them for myself and I don&#039;t really do them for the girls! Well, that&#039;s a lie. We do dinner, then bath (some nights), then put on pull-ups &#038; pajamas, brush their teeth, read three books, turn on the sound machine &#038; fan, pray, then put her into bed... and I&#039;m trying to be as consistent with this as possible! For the past few months she has managed to derail and drag out this routine as much as possible so it would take up to 3 hours to get through. Brutal.]]></description>
