		<description><![CDATA[Uhoh... it&#039;s all going downhill for you now! Hahahaha! I think people who have kids already aged way prematurely so my prime years are most definitely behind me - but I like to think that I&#039;ve still got it! ;-) I hope you had an excellent weekend!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go to your podcast screen (while you&#039;re listening) and on the very left side of the screen (next to the 15 second rewind button) is a number that probably says 1x. Click it to be 1.5x!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES. Let&#039;s text about this early bedtime thing. We have Clara sleeping from 7ish-7ish and life is wonderful. Isabelle on the other hand... all of the eye rolls. I&#039;m clueless here, but are Americanos just drip coffee or is it an espresso drink? For some reason drip coffee makes me jittery so I avoid it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand her stance either butttt i mean that&#039;s the show so I guess it&#039;s expected she wants to be actually ENGAGED and not just with a boyfriend. But I can&#039;t see Peter being the Bachelor because if we know he won&#039;t get engaged after only a few weeks of &#039;dating&#039; then how is he going to be The Bachelor when that&#039;s very CLEARLY the show&#039;s expectation? I&#039;m all about Dean being the Bachelor, though! I don&#039;t really like Bryan.. I can&#039;t explain it, but I don&#039;t trust him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No Google necessary - it&#039;s Eric and Bryan. And yes, 31 is a whole new level of attractive - let me tell you. If only I didn&#039;t look so tired... haha! I think that kind of ruins everything! ;-)]]></description>
