		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, I feel you on the spider situation. I could pay like $20 in rent monthly if we included all the daddy long legs that think it&#039;s their home too on the bill, haha. There was one particularly gigantic one that kept scaring the living daylights out of me whenever it&#039;d creep into my line of vision, but his life came to an end a couple of weekends ago when I vacuumed him up, finally. Haha. But seriously, it&#039;s never-ending. I think I&#039;ve vacuumed all of them and their webs up, only to find a new web like two days later. BUT, out of all the bugs that could infest my home, and out of all the spiders that could be part of that bug infestation, I&#039;d choose daddy long legs every time. I certainly don&#039;t like them, but I find them less gross and less terrifying (not to mention less destructive) than other possible invaders.]]></description>
