		<description><![CDATA[super interesting on the conversation about &#039;friend limits!&#039; since we moved back to CO, i am feeling a lack of mom friends so i keep talking to my husband about us finding parent friends. his response is along the lines of &#039;eh. i have enough friends and not enough time to invest in new ones!&quot;

i get what he&#039;s saying because he travels a ton and his time is limited. we do have GREAT friends back in portland but to me - i need some in person hang time! it&#039;s also weird because he&#039;s the extrovert and i&#039;m the introvert. who knoooows.

ps. i ADORE these photos!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the introvert/extrovert discussion is super interesting, too. I lean very, very introvert. My husband is right on the line.
Personally, I have two best friends (who aren&#039;t close with one another) and then maybe 2 other close friends. I have friends outside of those 4 people that I invite to parties or hang out with when the moment arises, but I really only invest consistent time and energy into four people tops (plus the husband and family members). And I 100% need time to myself. I prefer to only load up one weekend day with activity and then spend the rest of it alone or decompressing. Obviously things don&#039;t always work out that way, but my mood gets EXTREMELY sour when we have busy weekend on top of busy weekend...]]></description>
