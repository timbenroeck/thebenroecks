		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this. Not a mom, as you know, but I nannied and have close friends with babies and I totally get this. The boredom vs. stimulation vs. love vs. total frustration. It&#039;s a great time and a hard time but all I&#039;ve ever heard is it gets better and easier, right!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I honestly can&#039;t imagine being a SAHM. I think the job would be incredibly tough physically, mentally, and emotionally. I don&#039;t have kids that I&#039;m emotionally attached to, so the idea of hanging out with tiny, mostly non-verbal humans for +24 hours a day (lol) is terrifying to me. I know it&#039;s rewarding beyond belief at times, but as a childless human I have nothing but admiration and wonder for SAHMs :) Lol]]></description>
