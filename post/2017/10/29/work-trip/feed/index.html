		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you think so, too! You always make it look easy! I&#039;m sure if I was more used to it I&#039;d have an easier time with our schedule, but really I think that these kids may just be too much for my sanity without quite a few breaks in my day/evening!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[two kids alone is a totally different ballgame when the spouse travels. i dreaded joe traveling every single time when william was tiny and had no semblance of a schedule. i still don&#039;t love it, but i at least know that they will &quot;probably&quot; go to bed at the same time...kudos to you for surviving! it&#039;s probably so much more stressful to deal with when you&#039;re not used to it!]]></description>
