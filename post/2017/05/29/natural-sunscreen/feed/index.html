		<description><![CDATA[Oh wow, this list is great, thanks! I will definitely start to recommend thinkbaby -- just looked it up and the zinc oxide content looks great, and if it runs in well and isn&#039;t super pasty, that&#039;s awesome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard of a lot of people using Babyganics! From the EWG site it looks like the mineral-based lotion is better than the pure mineral sunscreen lotion, but both are good! I&#039;m glad you found the post helpful!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I literally just spent $24 on different forms of Babyganics and then I came home to read this post. I wish I would have seen it earlier! Wow... so interesting. I honestly have never heard of a single brand you just mentioned, which make me wonder if I&#039;m being laid back in a good way or bad. Yikes!! This is such a well-written post with excellent information. Thank you for sharing!! Truly!]]></description>
