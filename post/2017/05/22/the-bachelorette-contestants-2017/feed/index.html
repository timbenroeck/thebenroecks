		<description><![CDATA[I definitely don&#039;t know who any of the people are yet! I always have to check the recaps to figure out who&#039;s still in it. I don&#039;t have any early favorites after the in-person intros, but I&#039;m sure that will change!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve watched enough seasons of this franchise now to know that it will take me at least four or five episodes to actually remember who any of these people are. I don&#039;t know how ABC manages to only find people who look exactly like all the other people, but they sure seem to succeed at that every season of the Bachelor(ette), which makes it SO DIFFICULT to remember who&#039;s who!

On the other hand, I also think I&#039;ve watched enough seasons of the franchise at this point to have figured out the formula for the show, like how the people who&#039;s introduction to Rachel got spliced in the middle of someone else&#039;s monologue are most DEFINITELY going home night one (sorry, Rob. I saw your early exit coming a mile away.). So, based on that, I think Josiah and Diggy stand a decent chance, and possibly Jack Stone as well (the fact that he seems to basically be Rachel in male form doesn&#039;t hurt, either, between the lawyering and the dog ownership.) I don&#039;t have anyone that I particularly like yet, probably because I have basically no recollection of who&#039;s who, but I&#039;m sure that will change in due time.]]></description>
