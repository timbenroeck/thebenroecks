		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha that sounds AWFUL!!! I can&#039;t imagine trying to handle potty training with different people involved with the process. Also, with us it was really Clara who decided she was done with diapers and thankfully we didn&#039;t have to do any convincing there. I definitely don&#039;t think all kids are ready as early as 2 years old!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About 6 years ago I was a nanny and the family decided it was time for their barely two year old to be potty trained, and guess who got to do the honors! ME! It did not go so well. She would do well during the week when I was there, but then the weekend came and things were way more lax. Plus, her family (she  had multiple older sisters) would go out and do all kinds of things and it was just easier to put her in a diaper. That was a REALLY frustrating like, SIX MONTHS for me. I&#039;m glad your experience went really well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clara goes through phases of waking up dry, but we&#039;re out of pull-ups for naps now, which is nice. Today she peed TWICE IN THREE MINUTES in her underwear &#038; dresses and couldn&#039;t tell me why. I was SOOOOOOO annoyed. I was like &quot;CLARA, big girls do not pee in their pants!&quot; and her only response was &quot;Mom! I&#039;m not wearing pants, I&#039;m wearing a dress!&quot;

Lord give me patience for this toddler.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are such a down-to-earth mom. Your parenting advice is always so positive and spot on (or so I assume). I&#039;m giggling pretty hard about the potty in the car trunk and Clara&#039;s enthusiasm, but if it works it works!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thank goodness we chatted before we took the plunge with Amelia! we had a very similar experience (although I did have to push my dear one, as she would have happily stayed in diapers forever, even though she could tell me exactly what she was doing in said diapers...). we are out of pull-ups during the day, have been for a while. I think I may have missed my window for getting out of pull-ups at bedtime easily...she was waking up dry, and now she is waking up wet. but we weren&#039;t ready for her to be in a big girl bed yet, so c&#039;est la vie! this is such a super helpful post, especially the no-shaming tip with accidents...it can be so hard to not overreact when it happens, but so good not to!]]></description>
