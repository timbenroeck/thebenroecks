		<description><![CDATA[12 hour days are just TOO LONG for this mama! Great job, lady!!! I can&#039;t wait to get the sandals in the mail... I hope they fit because I&#039;m awful at buying shoes for the girls. I should have ordered multiple sizes - yay for free returns!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Omg, Nick has had a LOT of 6am-6pm work days (with a few overnight traveling days thrown in there) lately and I&#039;m dying. And I only have one baby to take care of! Hang in there lady! Also- can&#039;t wait till Hadley can fit into Saltwater sandals because they are ADORABLE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good luck with weaning! I was definitely ready to be done when it was time, and I&#039;m thankful it wasn&#039;t a whole big thing. But I know it can be for some people, so I hope it goes well for you! :)]]></description>
