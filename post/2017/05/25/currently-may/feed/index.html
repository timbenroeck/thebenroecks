		<description><![CDATA[This weekend will be the first weekend since the weekend before Easter that I&#039;ll be in the city of Chicago for the whole weekend, Friday afternoon-Sunday night (and Monday, in this case), so my plan for the weekend is to catch up on ALL OF THE CHORES. I&#039;ve been getting by with the bare minimum/absolutely necessary for the past six weeks, so my apartment is a disaster zone. I can&#039;t wait to make it look nice again. I have an overly ambitious to-do list for the weekend, since I have zero plans (including cleaning out my closet AND my dresser, both of which could probably take up one entire weekend on their own if I let them haha), but I&#039;m motivated to get as much done as possible that I&#039;m feeling fairly optimistic about my chances of at least getting through a decent part of it. (It also helps that I put tasks I know will get done, like running and going to church and grocery shopping and food prep, on my to do list, so I&#039;ll get through more if it, even if some of the &quot;tasks&quot; aren&#039;t really tasks :P)

I don&#039;t know how I feel about Bryan on the Bachelorette. I wasn&#039;t surprised that he got the first impression rose, but I get a weird vibe from him. He just seems...slimy. Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m definitely not sold on him yet.]]></description>
