		<description><![CDATA[Bensen does play pretty independently, which is nice, but he&#039;s into everything right now and has a habit of waiting until I&#039;m nursing Emmy to start to be trouble. It&#039;s his way of getting attention. I hear you on spending half of your life nursing though! I pump at least 3 times a day on days when I&#039;m home, to keep my supply stocked in the freezer for when I&#039;m not working or not home. I&#039;m already planning a party for when I finish breastfeeding, is that awful? It&#039;s just not my favorite thing.... but I&#039;m sticking with it this time because I know how important it is for Emmy&#039;s health through the winter and just in general with her being so early. And, it&#039;s been a lot more successful this time around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hated having two under two and thankfully it&#039;s gotten a BIT easier now that Clara is older and a little more independent. A TINY more independent. I know Bensen already seems to play way better by himself than Clara does and I&#039;m jealous! I feel like I spend half my life nursing and now that she&#039;s 8 months old it&#039;s slightly less, but still SO MUCH TIME.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Holy smokes, 30 babies!! That&#039;s insane! 2015/early 2016 must have been a fertile time for your friends! Haha. I&#039;m glad things are getting better for you, and hopefully that trend will continue well into 2017 and beyond :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is a LOT of babies to have met this year! I can&#039;t speak from experience, but I have to assume having 2 babies gets easier with time. Both your girls have a lot of spunk and personality though and that&#039;s such an awesome thing :) I hope you look back in 15 years and think 2016 was one of your best years, but if not, meh - who cares! 2017 can be your year :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over 30 babies?? Dang, girl. So many playmates and forever-friends for Clara and Isabelle! Also, 60 books is dang impressive with two little humans to take care of (and even for someone without that kind of responsibility!).
My word for 2016 was &quot;embrace&quot;, too. It fit pretty well for my year :)]]></description>
