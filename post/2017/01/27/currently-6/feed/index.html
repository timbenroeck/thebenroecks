		<description><![CDATA[CORINNE. I cannot believe that people like her are real human beings. I mean, to be fair, she seems awfully drunk during most of her interviews, which I&#039;m sure doesn&#039;t do her any favors. But MAN. She is just something else. I have Vanessa, Rachel, and Danielle M. (the nurse) in my final four in my fantasy league (*dies of shame*), so I&#039;m rooting for the three of them, but Danielle in particular because I have her winning it all. Though based on screen time, I feel like Vanessa has the best chance out of the three of them. I&#039;m super interested to see what goes down on Monday. My roommate and I are predicting a two-on-one with Taylor and Corrine, like the two-on-one with Chad and whoever the other guy on that date was in the last season of The Bachelorette.]]></description>
