		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, this sounds SO cool. In all the times I&#039;ve been to Seattle, we&#039;ve never gone whale watching, but now I&#039;m going to beg my family to go the next time we&#039;re there. Seeing all of that wildlife in nature must have been amazing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We went whale-watching off Massachusetts in July and we were still bundled up in windbreakers and hoodies :) It was an awesome experience. We saw dolphins and a few different kinds of whales. I&#039;m so glad we were able to do it. You&#039;re right- there really is nothing like seeing animals in their natural habitat.]]></description>
