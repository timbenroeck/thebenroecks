		<description><![CDATA[Gosh your 2016 was BUSY! Which I knew, of course, before reading this comment, but when I read it all at once it really does seem VERY exhausting and stressful. I think you can use some additional stillness and I love that you&#039;re focusing on it for 2017! I think there&#039;s something to not trying to change or do anything, but instead investing in what you already have. I can always improve on that. Great thoughts per usual, friend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must say, a week into it, I love my word! I&#039;ve put makeup on every day, whether I feel like it&#039;s necessary or not, and I feel WAY better. I&#039;m also doing an outfit challenge so I&#039;ve put on a put-together outfit every day and that&#039;s helped a ton too! You&#039;re right, it totally makes a difference!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uff, I still do not know how to do hair/makeup, which does cause me a lot of unnecessary stress (like right before events when I remember I don&#039;t know how to apply any eye makeup properly or own any of the right products)... this is a legit resolution! My (male) friend started a company called Beautylish and knows way more about any of this than me, they hired a bunch of YouTube stars to make tons of great tutorials for their website, check it out!! Their mobile page and app are not great, go for the (free) desktop videos -- here is their hair curling tutorial page: https://www.beautylish.com/videos/hair-curling

I&#039;ve thought a lot about what word I need right now (I think my 2016 word was &quot;need&quot; and my goal was to be aware of and responsive to my own needs, which was a huge success and helped me get through quite a lot!)... I am going to borrow your word from a couple years ago and aim for &quot;stillness&quot; in 2017. I had so many changes occur in 2016 (dragging myself to the residency finish line, applying for and then choosing/starting a new job, moving towns, Mangesh moving in -- also planning a couple big/complicated trips, and my new nephew&#039;s birth + his significant health conditions and very long NICU stay + re-hospitalizations, and my dog had a major illness, plus some deaths in the family... wow, no wonder I am exhausted), and I&#039;m happy with how I was able to handle and juggle everything, but it was extremely stressful!! 

I still haven&#039;t quite relaxed, and planning for all of these changes has gotten me into the habit of feeling like I need to be constantly moving forward, which leaves me quite stressed about the future. In 2017, I am going to just stay still and focus on 2017. I can worry about 2018 in 2018. I will stay still in my current job and make the most of it. I will stay still and invest in my positive relationships. I will stay still in my awesome neighborhood and think about my community here. I will stay still in my body and take good care of it now. I will stay still with my thoughts and feelings and allow them to develop so that I can express them. Phew, this is going to be good for me. I am starting to feel better already :)]]></description>
