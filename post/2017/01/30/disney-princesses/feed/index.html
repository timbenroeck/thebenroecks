		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve only seen Frozen once, but I was a huge fan! They have some really clever humor in there and it&#039;s obviously a much more female-friendly princess story!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t even care about kids rebelling against their parents, I&#039;m more concerned at the amount of death and awful step-parents and marrying someone who doesn&#039;t even know your name... it&#039;s all bad!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this, Lisa! I agree - I don&#039;t think that Disney makes the best stories. I especially don&#039;t like the idea of telling little girls that women are princesses to be saved by men. Although the disney versions are still more appropriate than the original Hans Christian Andersen / Grimm versions ... those are true nightmares
I like that book that you and Tim are reading Clara!]]></description>
