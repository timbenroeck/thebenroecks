		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t checked out Amazon Fresh!  Crazy since I use Amazon for everything.  I do like going to grocery stores and don&#039;t have any reason to not go (no kids, and there are lots of places nearby).  i&#039;m sure it&#039;s great for moms like you!

Thanks for joining our linkup :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving season 2, too! I&#039;m definitely watching less TV these days but I love a good show to binge watch once the kids go to bed (IF THEY EVER GO TO BED). I&#039;m also really into Netflix documentaries!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t actually know if it&#039;s limited to cities, but I do know there are lots of options we considered but Tim decided on Amazon Fresh (over Instacart and Peapod and some other ones). Our tree is still up, too. BUT, it&#039;s starting to die so I feel like its time is coming.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I love Nick. You&#039;re right, there are &#039;older&#039; women this season! I never even thought about it! I just know that my &#039;team&#039; of 5 women I picked based on the online bios is AWFUL. All five are still in, but one is clearly the season villain and one already slept with Nick sooooo yeah, not looking promising.]]></description>
