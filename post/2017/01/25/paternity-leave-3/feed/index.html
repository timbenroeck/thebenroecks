		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Just, wow. That is a huge blessing. I had my baby on a Monday and Jordan was back at work on that same Thursday. He doesn&#039;t get any PTO and we can&#039;t afford for him to take much time off. I can&#039;t even imagine what it would be like to have that much time as a family!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My fiancé works in banking and they recently started offering 3 months paid paternity leave. I was all excited until he informed me it was a &quot;career killing&quot; move at the his level and the most he would take is one month. However, most men I know only take one week so a month would still be glorious! 

My company only offers 6 weeks for women, at 60% salary. Very disappointing.  I plan to stay home when we have kids so it won&#039;t affect me but I am very jealous of my friends with generous maternity leave policies!  This is a major area where the US is sorely lacking. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really can&#039;t believe people don&#039;t take it more. I guess I can somewhat understand. Even during my unpaid leave, I had questions and work things coming in constantly, because my position is unique to me and although there was someone to take over those duties, there are so many non routine things that happen, I got questions about them. I would be all over twelve weeks of leave!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree. I think people (mainly men, I&#039;d assume) don&#039;t take their full leave because they simply would rather be at work than at home with a newborn. And for Tim&#039;s specific job he gets paid for the leave but his bonus gets prorated to exclude the 12 weeks, and since his bonus is a large part of his salary it still ends up costing us quite a bit of money. But to me it was SOOOO worth it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two weeks is just not enough time for paternity leave! I mean, a c-section recovery takes at least six weeks! (And unfortunately that&#039;s what I had both times). I&#039;m glad you have family coming in to help out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, his company is definitely moving in the right direction and I hope more follow! 4 weeks of maternity leave is RIDICULOUS and some women don&#039;t get any paid leave! Such awful stuff. We have a long way to go as a nation to support families!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is amazing and I am so envious of that system. I just met another mom who moved here from Sweden and I think she said her and her husband got 40 weeks off to split... or maybe it was 400 days... either way it was a ton of time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And I met someone at Clara&#039;s preschool who just came over from Sweden and she got FORTY WEEKS PAID to split between her and her husband. So amazing. America still has a long way to go in supporting families!
