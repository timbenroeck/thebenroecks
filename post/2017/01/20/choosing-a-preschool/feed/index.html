		<description><![CDATA[Oh man. My list is: does the catholic school at our church have a preschool? yes? great, let&#039;s go there. haha as a bonus it is a five minute walk away, so even though it&#039;s only 2.5 hours long, it&#039;s still worth it. Clara&#039;s school sounds amaaaazing, I want to go there!]]></description>
