		<description><![CDATA[william was so offended that we chopped down the tree we picked out, he just kept crying and crying until he realized we didn&#039;t just push it down for fun, we were bringing it home. now he points and &quot;asks&quot; for me to turn on the lights every morning the second he wakes up. thank goodness. 

also, i totally agree that it&#039;s more fun now that the oldest understands what&#039;s happening. like times a million.]]></description>
