		<description><![CDATA[I think I might have to break down and buy it. I&#039;ve been doing the youtube listening so far, but....I like it a lot! Also, how dare you inform me about that candle sale? Do you know how hard it was for me to restrain myself from purchasing some? I&#039;m still working my way through last year&#039;s purchases haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m on the fence about reputation, too. I&#039;ve bought all of Taylor Swift&#039;s previous albums, but I just have not been into any of the singles off this new one so far. I always liked her songwriting, but I feel like the lyrics on the singles at least are SO below what she used to do...so I don&#039;t know. I also barely ever buy music these days, too, which doesn&#039;t help much in the &quot;motivation to buy Reputation&quot; department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That image is hilarious.
I&#039;m irritated that TSwifts album isn&#039;t available for streaming on Spotify. Veryyy stingy, Miss Swift...
Well now I guess I need new pillows and candles. Thanks!]]></description>
