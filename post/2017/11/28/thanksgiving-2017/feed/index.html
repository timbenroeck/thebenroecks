		<description><![CDATA[This is probably totally unwanted info. But I had one kiddo that had similar issues, and later found out they were night terrors, and their cycles need to be reset to break that cycle. Feel free to email me... I&#039;m not selling anything, I just feel for you and I know how great it was to finally break the cycle, and learn the triggers for them later on. I&#039;m new to your blog, you maybe already have worked through all these possibilities. If so, just ignore.

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes I long for the day when the toughest part of a holiday was the time I dropped my sweet potato casserole and it didn&#039;t look quite as pretty as it had before we left our house. It had a lid, so it all stayed in the container, but man, that was a rough Thanksgiving ;) jk

But I have to agree with the comments below! My first thought was that your hair and lipstick are on point! You wear &quot;mom of two&quot; super well friend!]]></description>
