		<description><![CDATA[We definitely had the best weather for Easter, thank goodness because it&#039;s been all downhill since then... Now that Clara knows there are chocolates in those eggs next year she&#039;ll be tackling the other kids and elbowing them out of the way for more eggs - haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First time I&#039;m over at your site, and I&#039;m so happy you found me so that I could find you. :) We have two little girls as well, so it&#039;ll be fun to read your material! Looks like you all had a beautiful Easter weekend. I cracked up at your story about being so pregnant last Easter. I was too! I think I was 37 or 38 weeks pregnant, and I nearly had a meltdown taking our 2.5 year old to a huge Easter egg hunt. It was a disaster, and I was too pregnant to handle it. Haha!!]]></description>
