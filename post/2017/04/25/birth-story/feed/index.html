		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, GIRL. I&#039;m so sorry that everything went completely the opposite of how you wanted it to, that&#039;s just the worst. And I literally cannot believe she was TEN POUNDS. You win all the awards for just attempting to get her out!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A 10 POUND BABY?! You brave woman! I can totally related to not wanting to be pregnant again. I had my second baby in September and although both my births pretty much went as well as pushing a watermelon out of a donut hole can go, I would really prefer not to go through that again. I don&#039;t think my husband can handle another round of pregnancy and childbirth either! Lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, it wasn&#039;t as scary as I had feared, and the physical recovery wasn&#039;t as bad as I had feared. Of course, having 2 whole weeks to catch up on sleep and recuperate following their birth probably had something to do with it!! :) I actually went into labor on my own, the day after my dr appt where we scheduled the c-section, so as soon as it was confirmed in triage I was whisked off to the OR. I was glad it happened the way it did, because if I had had too much time to anticipate it, I&#039;m sure I would have worked myself up into quite a state!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How was the c-section? I really think I would have had such an easier time with a planned c-section, but I really wanted the VBAC! With a planned c-section I would have been present for the birth, though, because I know the spinal tap would have worked the first time before the baby dropped a bit. And I probably would have avoided spinal headaches. Sigh. If only I had known.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I think pregnant women generally want to hear the &#039;nicest&#039; birth stories but the women who have had babies before love swapping horror stories! Personally, I still can&#039;t handle hearing about people&#039;s &#039;easy&#039; labor and deliveries because it just makes me feel bad... I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get there in time, though.]]></description>
