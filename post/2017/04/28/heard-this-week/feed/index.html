		<description><![CDATA[This has been my week too!! Yesterday was one of those toddler days. I&#039;d ask Bensen to do something or not do something and try to redirect and he&#039;d just keep doing what he was doing like I was invisible. I&#039;d ask him, &quot;Bensen, are you listening to me?&quot; and he&#039;d reply calmly, &quot;No.&quot; &#039;sigh&#039; ...... it was a very long day that day :P]]></description>
