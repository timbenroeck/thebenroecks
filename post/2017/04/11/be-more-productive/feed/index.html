		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh I&#039;m sure my girls don&#039;t get very much of my undivided attention... I always seem to be multi-tasking which is something I know I need to stop doing! Even though sometimes the multi-tasking is socializing with friends on playdates while they play with friends or something like that. I&#039;m just not good at playing with them at home, although we do read a lot so I guess that counts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Letting the kids play on their own is awesome! I&#039;ve been trying to finish a project and I&#039;ve structured my day into hourly segments to help me out. I&#039;ll spend time eating breakfast with Bensen and getting him and Emmy ready for the day and then I let him have independent play time during the first hour of her morning nap, while I get something done. That next hour of her morning nap, we play together. I never feel guilty because when I think about it at the end of the day, he gets at least 3 or 4 hours of my undivided attention each and every day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure if you know this but you can download a Facebook groups app! I find I spend way too much time scrolling my actual feed, but the groups app is great if you want to keep up with challenges or your neighbourhood etc. :) 
I love that second point. It&#039;s absolutely true and such an important skill for kids to learn. Since I am a full-time working mom I obviously prioritize my time during weekdays with them as special quality time (usually 2ish hours a day) but on weekends I am happy to let them play by themselves why we are nearby in the kitchen or laundry room etc. 
good luck!!!]]></description>
