		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m SO glad things are going well for you guys!!!  Just recently Caleb has started waking up during the night because he loses his blanket.  It&#039;s getting old, fast!  At least he falls back asleep as soon as he&#039;s covered up again...  Can&#039;t say the same about his mama who&#039;s also dealing with a nursing baby...  #NoSleepAtOurHouse]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, bedtime with two is definitely a circus. Luckily, Emmy is a breeze, she just likes a quick song and to be laid down in her crib and left alone, and Bensen will usually help me sing her songs. Bensen has become another story when going to bed, but I blame it on his routine being off because Joe has had to be gone past bedtime more than one night a week and that kid is a creature of habit. But he also woke up in the middle of the night the other day and I ended up in his bed for who knows how long because he&#039;d been sobbing and every time I thought he was asleep and would slowly slide off his bed, his eyes would open and he&#039;d tell me, &quot;I need you mommy&quot; .... how can I say no to that?!?! Why don&#039;t kids appreciate sleep like they should?!?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Continued good luck!! Sounds like you are in a sweet spot right now! Our girls (6 and 3 1/2) go to bed between 6:30 and 7 and wake up around 6 ideally (we need to get out the door by 7am) so this sounds similar!! Oh and I should mention that they have been on that sleep schedule since they were roughly your girls&#039; age so it has been pretty consistent and worked well for us :)]]></description>
