		<description><![CDATA[Drink up apple cider mimosas, ASAP! So good! I would like to think that whether people kneel or stand for the anthem it&#039;s not an indication of their respect (or lack thereof) for veterans - I think we can all agree that they should be respected! I&#039;m just annoyed because it&#039;s all such a (contrived) sh*t show to distract from other political messes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more with respect to your NFL comments. What a disaster - in the White House. Great blog, Lisa. I really enjoy your Airbnb posts - especially as we set out to start up our own about 500 miles away from where we live!]]></description>
