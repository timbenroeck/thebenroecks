		<description><![CDATA[OH GEESH. At least once we got to the car we could get home - I would have been pissed if we had locked our keys in there! I think parenting is all about setting the bar low... I&#039;m still working on that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mean, I&#039;m not asking them to LIVE in it, I just want it to be a novelty for a few hours! Thank goodness we don&#039;t live in Chicago anymore because we&#039;d be stuck inside FOREVER! And yes, bring on the sunshine and warmer weather!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;ve got the right approach setting the bar really low. This reminds me of a similar experience I had once in the summer when my girls were similar ages to yours - they were both overheating and screaming their heads off and I accidentally locked our car keys in the trunk...haha oops. The photos you took are absolutely beautiful though!!!]]></description>
