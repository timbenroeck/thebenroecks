		<description><![CDATA[I agree. I don&#039;t understand why the Bachelorette was announced early and now I don&#039;t really like watching any of the rose ceremonies as much because WHEN IS RACHEL GOING HOME?! Maybe no one gets the final rose. I would love that. I was so convinced that Rachel was going home last week because why would Nick keep Corinne this long and then NOT bring her into a fantasy suite?! The whole thing makes no sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SHE STILL HASN&#039;T. What the heck, April?! I was underwhelmed by Raquel, I must admit. Wah wah.

Maybe I should give up yelling at Ozzie! I&#039;m not sure I could do it, quite honestly. The other day he woke up BOTH GIRLS from their naps and I was none too pleased.]]></description>
