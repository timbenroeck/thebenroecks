		<description><![CDATA[I miss the days when most bloggers would write more personal posts (not necessarily &quot;Let me tell you about my deep dark secret&quot; posts but just, &quot;This is what I did with my day/week&quot; sort of posts). I always found those was more interesting than posts that completely remove the human element from them in favor of SEO, hits, clicks, etc. Obviously that stuff is important if you&#039;re generating income through your blog, but I found it much easier to get invested in a blogger if they talked about them and what was going on in their life rather than other things!

Your painting is so pretty! I&#039;ve done a few of those painting classes over the years and I&#039;m always so surprised how much better my paintings turned out than I would&#039;ve expected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always look SO SHORT compared to my friends. And I&#039;m really not! I&#039;m 5&#039;5&quot;! (That painting is so pretty!)
Good for you for volunteering to help others with their taxes!
