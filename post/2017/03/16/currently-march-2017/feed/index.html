		<description><![CDATA[I feel like all of my comments revolve around Seattle, but alas... here&#039;s another one. Did you read Where&#039;d you go Bernadette since moving here? It&#039;s so interesting to read knowing the area because I can actually picture where she&#039;s talking about. Great book, one of my favorites!]]></description>
