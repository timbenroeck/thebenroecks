		<description><![CDATA[So true on your point about Jojo&#039;s men. I mean, were we going to like Robby as The Bachelor? No. But did you see the 4 men they introduced to Rachel in the After The Rose show?! NO NO NO. Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dang girl. Your life is WAY more social than mine! A marriage conference? That sounds interesting! 
I love rainy, dreary weather. A PNW spring sounds nice. Ohio spring includes mornings with 3 in. of snow, afternoons in the 60s, and evenings of 40 degree storms. UGH.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I swear I do more with my life besides watching The Bachelor, despite what my commenting habits on your blog suggest. Hahaha. I just appreciate that you give me a place to gossip about the show. But YES, last week&#039;s episode was an even bigger waste of time than the vast majority of that New Orleans episode a few weeks ago. Totally pointless. They may as well have just done a Women Tell All and skipped the &quot;real&quot; episode for how much they phoned it on on that one. Come on, ABC! I expect more out of you! Haha. I&#039;ve vented enough about the idiocy of telling us Rachel was the Bachelorette before she even went home, so I&#039;ll spare you that rant this time around. But I&#039;m really interested to see how her season plays out. I agree that she&#039;s really normal (only in Bachelor World does that count as a bad thing hahaha), but maybe they&#039;ll make up for it with the contestants? I mean, that&#039;s usually who brings the crazy anyway. Ben was a normal human being and I really enjoyed his season of the Bachelor. But I do hope the crop of guys they get for Rachel is better than all the guys they had for Jojo. That was a super lame season of the Bachelorette, in my opinion. I mean, if the producers thought NICK was a better Bachelor candidate than ANY of the guys on Jojo&#039;s season, I think I have a valid point :P]]></description>
