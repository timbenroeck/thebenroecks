		<description><![CDATA[Yep, I knew my baby was a girl before I had her! This time I&#039;m not sure though... I feel extra pressure to guess the gender correctly since I was right last time! It&#039;s definitely fun not finding out - I recommend it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I knew my son was a boy, even before we were told he was. Some part of me just &#039;knew&#039;, and so it really was no surprise when we found out. I was so excited though, and LOVED every second of awaiting my little boy. 
I&#039;ve already decided, however, that I will NOT be finding out the gender of baby #2 (a long ways down the road! haha). I bet it&#039;s a completely different feeling during pregnancy, not truly knowing who you&#039;ll be welcoming into your family. I think not finding out the gender beforehand makes for a really special birthday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CONGRATS! You must be thrilled to be in the second trimester... time starts going by faster and faster, you&#039;ll be in the third trimester before you know it! Not finding out the gender is still a decision I&#039;m SUPER happy with. And I agree, knowing ahead of time is like opening presents early or &#039;ruining&#039; any sort of big surprise! Good for you on trying to stay healthy during your pregnancy, I&#039;ve found it to be a little bit of a struggle for me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t blame you! I always thought I would want to know the gender way ahead of time (ASAP!), too. But somehow, pregnancy has made me super calm about the whole thing and I actually don&#039;t WANT to plan anything! It&#039;s seriously strange. Instead of the hormones making me a crazy person, they&#039;ve de-crazied (totally a verb) me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh you both have more strength than me! I 100% want to know what the gender is (when and if) I have a baby. It&#039;s fun watching others do it but I think I would go bonkers if if I was in your position!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh that&#039;s awesome that you&#039;re already both in agreement on it! I&#039;m not a gender reveal type of person... or a shower person. BUT, people want to throw me showers and I&#039;m very flattered, so we will be having some! It would be cute to get SOME gender specific clothes ahead of time, but I guess I&#039;ll be doing some online shopping like CRAZY once this baby comes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t want to find out either (when it comes to that) and my husband agrees.  I also come from a tradition that doesn&#039;t do baby showers/a lot of prep ahead of time so there is no real &quot;need&quot; to know.  Most of my friends did find out but we&#039;re not really a gender reveal party crew, more of just a text and pass it on.]]></description>
