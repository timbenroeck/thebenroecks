		<description><![CDATA[It was indeed a great trip, Kari! I&#039;m glad you loved Savannah, too! I think it&#039;s so underrated and it was just so so beautiful there! I&#039;m glad we went in the spring before it gets overwhelmingly hot and humid! I have not seen read the Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil but of course now I want to read it because it was alllll over the place there! Have you read it and was it worth the read?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great trip! I loved visiting Savannah.  It was so beautiful there and magical with all the Spanish moss hanging.  There were so many sights to see that I donâ€™t blame you for not being able to resist walking all over town.  Have you ever read/seen Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil?  It is set in
Savannah, and one of the tours may have pointed out the house the real person used to live.  Canâ€™t wait to read the recap of your 2nd babymoon:)]]></description>
