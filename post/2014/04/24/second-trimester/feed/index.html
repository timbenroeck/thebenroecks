		<description><![CDATA[Me?  I can&#039;t believe how far along you are!  I mean, it makes total sense that you would be progressing at the same rate that I am, but it still seems so crazy that you&#039;re in the third trimester too!  (Maybe it just confirms to me just how close the end is!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, I can&#039;t believe we only have 10 weeks left! I only threw up once all pregnancy and it was on a random morning in my 17th week... so it was probably just a fluke and hopefully you won&#039;t have to deal with that grossness again!]]></description>
