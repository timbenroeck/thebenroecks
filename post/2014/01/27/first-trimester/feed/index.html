		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha! I never took a pregnancy test after I found out I was pregnant, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s totally normal ;-) And I agree, it&#039;s so hard to not talk about it when your brain is CONSUMED by all things pregnancy! Good luck, mama!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so happy to finally hear that someone else was/is paranoid. I just want to feel pregnant. Like is it totally normal to take a pregnancy test every week to make sure it still says pregnant?!?!? Also, thank you so much for writing this. It truly is such a weird time to not tell people when that is all  you want to talk about!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m on week 22 as of today!  :)  We were planning on keeping it a secret until 14 or 15 weeks and we even had a very elaborate plan all set up.  Then the hospital called my old phone number (at my parent&#039;s house) that they had on file rather than my new phone number I got after I moved out and got married.  We thought it best to tell everyone so my mom didn&#039;t have to keep it a secret any longer.  :)
It is special to have a secret together!  :)  But it was so hard for us to keep quiet!  lol!
Do you know if it&#039;s a boy or a girl?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[eep, it&#039;s been a while (my kid is 5YO) but i think i remember my belly popping around the 5month mark; at least that&#039;s when i really noticed it and everyone else did too.  as for the kicking...around the same time too - 5 months.  then she wouldn&#039;t&#039; stop kicking until she came out!!


all those crazy people preaching about selfish parents being this way or that way or whatever, they can all suck it.  you get it either way - if you have too many kids, only one kid, no kids, you&#039;re a selfish bitch.  if you pay too much attention to your kid, a little attention then you&#039;re a bad parent.  it&#039;s ridiculous.  i wish people would just mind their business!  good for you for ignoring all the negatives because that&#039;s all there is (at least it seems) and very few supportive people on the internet (other than me, of course :D)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, lovely!! Seriously, I&#039;ve been pretty much abusing Google lately. Which is especially awkward when I&#039;m commuting on the el and am concerned people around me could be looking over my shoulder and would probably horrified at what they see me looking for. Itchy boobs, squishing babies... totally normal things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the kind words, Rachel! Just don&#039;t search the internet for squishing babies. You won&#039;t squish your baby in your uterus and you will not find anything worth reading on the entire internet on the topic! Hahaha!]]></description>
