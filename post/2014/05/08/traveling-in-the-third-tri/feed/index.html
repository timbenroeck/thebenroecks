		<description><![CDATA[Have you started getting them yet?! It&#039;s weird because it doesn&#039;t feel like anything really, but you&#039;ll notice your abdomen suddenly feels like an over-inflated basketball. So strange!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh luckily we just had two seats next to the window, so neither of us needed to take a middle seat! Usually Tim makes me take the aisle so that he can lean against the window, but since I&#039;m pregnant and all, he let me have the window seat this trip :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The plane ride is SO worth it if you&#039;re going somewhere amazing, but definitely take the train if you can, especially since they&#039;re AMAZING in Europe and you&#039;re already there (I&#039;m so jealous)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The flight was uncomfortable, but pregnancy is also uncomfortable in general, so it&#039;s tolerable! Braxton Hicks are not my favorite, that&#039;s for sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can imagine it was SO much easier to take the train when pregnant than to take a plane ride. Remind me if I ever do get pregnant to NEVER take a plane journey, this doesn&#039;t sound fun at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have such a hard time sleeping on planes I can&#039;t imagine doing it with the bump!  It may have something to do with the fact that my husband always forces me to take the middle seat though haha.  So glad you guys enjoyed the trip and everything went smoothly!  Plenty of cafe stops sounds like my kind of trip :)]]></description>
