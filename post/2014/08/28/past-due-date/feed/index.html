I wish you the BEST OF LUCK in the very near future and for a happy and healthy baby/delivery! You&#039;ve got this, mama!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thank you thank you THANK YOU for writing this because it captures all the feels going on inside right now (oh hey, 41 weeks)!! Especially the thoughts towards the well-meaning people who tell me to get sleep and enjoy time with the hubs... love them, but that&#039;s definitely hard to do at this point. So thankful to read a post that is so honest and encouraging for this strange, exciting, and uncomfortable time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lisa, I&#039;m officially crying. Thank you for every single word you wrote. I&#039;m overdue by four days today, according to my very first ultrasounds (which I never really believed). You hit the nail on the head about how I&#039;m feeling right now and I just want to thank you. I&#039;m doing a natural birth in a tub and my midwife is going to let me go to 41 weeks and five day. Next week is going to be an exciting week for us if this little munchkin doesn&#039;t come this weekend. Think of us as we go through our journey and again, thank you for all your words. They mean more than you know! Take care! Whitney]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was so nice to read. Thank you! I am only 38.3 but I love reading/ hearing about positive pregnancy. There is way too much negative out there. So thank you again for this!! I feel I will go over my due date, and I am perfectly okay with that. My little man will come when HE is ready! And I will wait patiently for him :)]]></description>
