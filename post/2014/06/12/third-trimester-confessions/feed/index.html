		<description><![CDATA[Oh that makes me feel even better! So far I feel lucky/blessed that it hasn&#039;t been painful :-) I definitely read your post on people asking you about when you&#039;re going to have the baby already... I think I&#039;d become a pretty angry little elf if I have to deal with that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m at 41 weeks and I still love the kicks.  You won&#039;t necessarily hate them as time goes on.  :)
Also, great idea on telling people a different due date!  People are driving me up the wall... like it&#039;s my fault that my baby&#039;s not here yet.  Anyway, I posted a whole blog post ranting about it, so I won&#039;t do it here again. Haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was really cute. I&#039;ll be honest, I usually steer clear of &quot;bump dates.&quot; But, being someone NOT pregnant and not even ready to be there, I still felt like I could relate to this! So exciting for you!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW! It could be tomorrow or 5 weeks from today... Only God knows the exact date and time! Honestly, I wish we would have started on the nursery WAY earlier, because now I&#039;m exhausted and have no motivation to do it, plus it&#039;s hard to bend down and organize and all of that good stuff. My advice would be to do bits of it sooner rather than waiting until later!]]></description>
