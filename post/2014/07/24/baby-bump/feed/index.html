		<description><![CDATA[Haha YES posture changes ridiculously!!! It&#039;s supposed to though, your whole pelvis just has to tilt in order to hold an entire baby. I&#039;m still working on getting mine back to normal. PT was sooooo helpful, especially after surgery (and they can teach you lots of &quot;body mechanics&quot; things about carrying Clara and the car seat, etc). I just &quot;graduated&quot; last week! For the first 6 weeks I was going 3x/wk and it made the most enormous difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear ya! It&#039;s so intimidating to think of what COULD happen to your body during pregnancy (not to mention labor and delivery!) but I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t let fears stand in the way of me embarking on this journey, because it&#039;s been far easier than I ever thought it would be! Vainly, I can&#039;t help but think of how many hours/years I&#039;ve spent getting my body into shape, only to have a little person totally change it, but I think my fitness led to an easier pregnancy, so I&#039;m thankful for it, even though I&#039;ve completely lost my abs.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Serena! Basically, my abs split because I&#039;m petite and oblique dominant, so my abs separated straight down the center. I think it just means that I&#039;ll have some extra work to do to get back to my &#039;old&#039;/pre-pregnancy self :-) I actually thought pregnancy would be WAY harder on my little body, but I&#039;m pleased to report that this wasn&#039;t the case!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel like my posture has kind of changed since pregnancy, so I have to focus more on standing up straight than I did previously. I&#039;m excited to get the go-ahead to start working out soon, but I&#039;m trying to be patient with it since at this point I can only walk for about 20 minutes before I start getting too tired! Every day is better than the day before, though, so that&#039;s a blessing :-) I know you talked about physical therapy before, so I may look into that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vainly, I just hope that my &#039;normal&#039;/pre-pregnancy pants still fit in a few weeks so I don&#039;t have to spend a ton of money buying new jeans! My hips seem a bit bigger than they were before, but otherwise I&#039;m almost back at my normal weight already! Honestly, I&#039;m amazed at how well my body handled pregnancy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww thanks, Erin! I definitely had my moments of not feeling very pretty, but I really did love the baby bump. It&#039;s so amazing what our bodies (as women) are capable of doing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Rachel! I thought I looked great pregnant, but I&#039;m glad that my &#039;normal&#039; body is almost back! I can&#039;t wait to get the &#039;all clear&#039; from my midwives so I can start working out again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t let fears overwhelm me during the pregnancy... it definitely was nowhere near as bad as I feared it could be! And I agree, I have no idea how Clara fit in there, and why she was so comfortable for almost 42 weeks!]]></description>
