		<description><![CDATA[Oh that makes me happy to know! I keep trying to find encouraging stories about women who went into labor naturally with un-engaged babies. There should really be a support group for women who are 41+ weeks pregnant... it&#039;s not that easy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Hannah! I&#039;m definitely going to  be depending on Pure Barre after Bumpy makes his/her appearance... I already know I have split abs, so I&#039;m a bit concerned about what I&#039;ll look like post-birth. Although, I know that I&#039;ll probably be too tired and excited to be TOO vain :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha they definitely won&#039;t let you go 30 days over your due date, so don&#039;t worry about that! I think most hospitals will only allow you to go to 41 or 42 weeks :-) And congrats on 17 weeks! Time will fly by. And it&#039;s definitely a good idea to have someone on hand to groom your vag for you, it&#039;s amazing how inconvenient it becomes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the prayers! It will definitely be any day now... we&#039;re running out of time! I&#039;m very happy with the weight I&#039;ve put on, but it&#039;s still a bit shocking to see that number climb and climb!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I definitely wanted to! I&#039;m now at a solid 135 and am quite pleased with the weight I&#039;ve gained but don&#039;t want to add on any more at this point!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Crotchless bathing suits?  Why not just wear the hospital gown and get their stuff all messy instead of your own?  :P  Don&#039;t worry about the baby not dropping.  My midwife told me on Thursday (41 weeks) that baby hadn&#039;t dropped much.  I went into labour on Monday night and had the baby on Tuesday.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Crotchless bathing suits are probably for Sitz baths in case of sutures? I have never seen anyone bring crotchless anything to the hospital, thoughâ€¦ although I guess if someone was expecting a boatload of visitors, it might make sense? Except, no, why wouldn&#039;t you kick those people out, they should leave!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I already informed my sister that I am expecting her to groom my vag for me once I can no longer see down there. But moving on... Oh my goodness! I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re so close to meeting your little bumpy baby! I&#039;m 17 weeks and already freaking out about meeting him/her, I can&#039;t imagine being as close as you are and still waiting! Over the weekend, my aunt informed me that her first baby was born 30 DAYS past the due date. WTF, right? But can you imagine?!? The doctor thought they had miscalculated the due date, but once he was born the doctor said he had definitely been in there for too long. WHHHAAAAT?!? I didn&#039;t even know that 30 days was a possibility! But that was the 80s, I don&#039;t think they let that happen anymore these days, thank goodness. Good luck with your (hopefully really soon) delivery!]]></description>
