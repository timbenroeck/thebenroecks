		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words, Tricia!! We&#039;re all doing really well over here. I can&#039;t believe my baby (&#039;Bumpy&#039; when she was in the womb!) is almost 14 months old. I could cry just thinking about it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m very tardy to the party here, but I just stumbled across this and think it&#039;s awesome. I can absolutely relate to the feeling of losing your own identity and still wanting to be seen as YOU, not So-and-so&#039;s mom. You really had you&#039;re head on straight. (Especially for a pregnant lady.) I hope everything has been going well for you and the whole fam! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Amanda!!! I didn&#039;t really &#039;announce&#039; it via Twitter or Instagram or any other forms of social media... so it was easy to miss :-) I feel like I&#039;m going to go from having this small bump to HUGE BUMP overnight, so I&#039;m waiting for that transition to happen! We still haven&#039;t &#039;told&#039; the Facebook world we&#039;re pregnant yet and now I&#039;m wondering if we should just kind of wait until the birth... I mean, do our acquaintances really need to know the state of my uterus?! Is your friend doing any sort of announcement or just bypassing it entirely?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely missed this! I blame traveling. Congrats to you and your husband!!!! ahhhh! Ps, I&#039;m stalking some of your more recent posts, you&#039;re an adorable pregnant lady! I think it&#039;s really smart to wait to share that important tidbit of news. I have a friend who is 22 weeks and she still hasn&#039;t&#039; even shared on social media. To her and her husband it&#039;s just not that important. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh I remember you saying that! But I think 10 weeks is definitely a legit amount of time to tell people. By that time (or 11 weeks, rather) we were already seeing our little guy/gal rockin&#039; and rollin&#039; in there! I just liked keeping the secret longer, and it was almost like a challenge not to tell anyone!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha yeah I think the &#039;traditional&#039; length of time to tell people is 12 weeks, but heavy drinkers always have a harder time hiding it! I just sipped on real champagne at the wedding we went to on NYE. My doctor gave me the &#039;okay&#039; for a bit of alcohol here and there, so I just ignored the judgey looks from others :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We don&#039;t have any family nearby so that made it easier. I feel like the questions, comments, and advice started immediately, making those first 12 weeks sacred to me! In some ways I feel like it has been so fast, but in other ways it feels so long! I feel like the next few weeks are going to drag!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish I could have kept the secret for longer... it didn&#039;t take too long for me to get annoyed at the people who refused to let me lift anything heavier than a dinner plate (which had to be extra loaded because I was apparently supposed to be &quot;eating for two&quot;).  Oh, but I&#039;m still allowed to pick up my 20 lb nephew whenever I want....
Unfortunately, the hospital called my old phone number rather than my new one and my mom took the message.  We knew the secret was slowly eating away at her so we saved her some misery and told everyone at 10 weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[congrats!!!  


i told friends/family after the obligatory 12wks. i think it&#039;s 12wks, right?  damn, it was a long time ago but a lot of them suspected because we were at a wedding and normally i would be pounding back the shots, i was just sipping gingerale and trying to pass that off as champagne and feeling nauseous as hell.  congrats again!!]]></description>
