		<description><![CDATA[Awww I&#039;m glad you found me, too, Kelly! Definitely stay off the pregnancy boards as you get closer to your due date because the things people say will drive you NUTS. Everyone wants to induce at like 34 weeks! (And people keep confusing castrol oil with castor oil and it&#039;s all just disaster.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amen! Iâ€™m so glad I found your blog through The Peony Project! Knowing what I know now, being in my 3rd trimester, I almost laugh at my 1st trimester self. I wish I had found this post sooner in my pregnancy because you hit everything right on the nail. Iâ€™ve since stayed away from those pregnancy boards because it just makes you stress out more and your right about the judgement from other women. Such a great read :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. I can see how all that would be pretty scary to read while pregnant. I also see how it can be a good outlet for people. Thanks for the heads up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would never in a million years think of you as mean, Kait :-) My anxiety has DEFINITELY increased since Clara was born. But, it&#039;s because of my own world view and not necessarily because of the world view of strangers on message boards... if that makes sense! I definitely know/realize that horrible things happen and there&#039;s nothing (usually) we can do to protect ourselves from them. But, I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily useful for pregnant  (or any) women to be on boards filled with bad pregnancy news from strangers, because extra anxiety isn&#039;t good for anyone. This is also why I avoid the evening news... It&#039;s not that I avoid all negativity, but I try to focus on the happenings that actually affect myself and my loved ones, or our world as a whole. I guess I think there&#039;s a difference between seeking out truth, (potentially sensitive) stories and facts vs spending a lot of time in an online and almost completely anonymous community where people post heartbreaking news almost hourly, and without any background.]]></description>
