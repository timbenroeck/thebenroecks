						<p><strong>I honestly never knew how controversial breastfeeding was until I had Clara.</strong> Even when I was pregnant, I really didn&#8217;t read many things about breastfeeding (because I was too busy preparing for labor and delivery and reading all of the controversy surrounding that)!</p>
<p>To me, it was always a matter of, &#8216;well, I&#8217;m going to have a baby and she&#8217;s going to need to eat so I&#8217;ll breastfeed her.&#8217;</p>
<p><em>Simple, right?</em></p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t realize is that there can be quite a divide between women who breastfeed and women who use formula. (Honestly, I never knew that women used formula for their babies from birth, because my mom had my brother when I was 14 and I always saw her breastfeeding and I just assumed that&#8217;s what everyone did.)</p>
<p>For me personally, breastfeeding is &#8216;easy&#8217;*, so we haven&#8217;t even thought about supplementing with formula. Would I be disappointed if I had to supplement with formula? Yes, I probably would be. But do I think mothers who need to use formula are bad mothers?&nbsp;<strong>Absolutely not. </strong>(Although, if moms use formula without ever attempting to breastfeed, I would wonder if they had been educated about all of the benefits breastfeeding has.)</p>
<p><em>* I actually <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kind of</span> hate using the word &#8216;easy&#8217; to describe any part of motherhood. Nothing about motherhood is easy, but breastfeeding seems to come easier to Clara and me than it does other moms. I never had bleeding nipples, it was never painful, I have no problems with supply, I&#8217;m able to feed on demand, and Clara has had a great latch from day one. I credit some of this to the lactation consultants who gave us great advice in the hospital after we had Clara.</em></p>
<p>But actually, this blog post isn&#8217;t even about breastfeeding vs formula &#8211;<strong> it&#8217;s about another &#8216;debate&#8217; that I didn&#8217;t even know was an issue: Nursing in Public (NIP).</strong></p>
<p>Evidently there are a lot of women and men out there who do not believe women should nurse their babies in public (especially without a cover). Now, if you&#8217;re like I was before I actually had a baby, you might be thinking &#8216;Well, duh, just use a cover and don&#8217;t flash your boobs to the world. It&#8217;s not that hard, moms!&#8217;</p>
<p><em>Ohhhh if only I had known then what I know now.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the thing, being a mom is hard, and I refuse to make my life any harder than it needs to be in order to make other people (not including my baby, of course) more comfortable.&nbsp;</strong>This doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m a completely inconsiderate person, but when it comes to nursing my baby how babies are biologically meant to nurse, I do whatever makes Clara and I the most comfortable and that&#8217;s the only thing I worry about.</p>
<p>In theory, I could pump for lots of minutes every day to get some extra milk and then pack bottles every time we&#8217;re out and about so that Clara could eat from those, instead of allowing her to drink directly from the tap (my boob).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with this is <strong>I do not want to pump that often</strong>. It&#8217;s not comfortable and it requires too much planning! Figuring out how many bottles I &nbsp;might need for every outing would be exhausting. Cleaning pump parts is exhausting. Pumping takes time, time I do not want to spend being milked like a cow. I do pump when I feel engorged or when I know we&#8217;ll be leaving Clara with a babysitter, or when we&#8217;re going somewhere where I know I won&#8217;t want to breastfeed, but <strong>99% of the time, I bring Clara and my boobs and know that she&#8217;ll be taken care of if/when she gets hungry.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people wonder why moms can&#8217;t simply wear a cover over the baby if they must breastfeed in public. Once again, this is an extra step in my life that I just don&#8217;t want to worry about in order to make other people comfortable. I totally get that some moms don&#8217;t want to expose their breast(s) in public and would rather use a cover &#8211; and I think that&#8217;s great! Moms should do whatever they feel most comfortable with. But I do not &nbsp;believe it&#8217;s my responsibility (or any mom&#8217;s) to cover up so that other people don&#8217;t feel uncomfortable. Plus, some babies will pull the cover off and not eat under a cover at all (it can get hot in there)!</p>
<p>&#8230; And here&#8217;s where I could (and will) go on a bit of a tangent, because I&#8217;ve heard the argument made that &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to see a boob at a restaurant if I&#8217;m out with my husband on a date!&#8217; &#8216;I don&#8217;t want my husband to see boobs that aren&#8217;t mine!&#8217; &#8216;I don&#8217;t want my kids to see boobs!&#8217; And here is where I must point out that <strong>boobs are not sexual and feeding a child is not sexual.</strong> Our society has&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;breasts sexual, but there is nothing &#8216;dirty&#8217; about feeding a baby, or boobs in general. I would rather not see billboards of models in lingerie (which is blatantly sexual) or commercials with the same, etc etc, but I really can&#8217;t shield myself nor my husband (<em>not that I honestly care if Tim looks at women in underwear&#8230;</em>) nor my kid(s) away from it because<strong> it&#8217;s everywhere.</strong> There are plenty of women wearing low cut shirts with cleavage that show more skin than I show when I&#8217;m feeding Clara. If I flash an accidental nipple while breastfeeding &#8211; whoops! I&#8217;m sure if anyone sees it, they&#8217;ll recover with a minimal amount of therapy.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NIP.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><sub>Tim snapped this photo of us in Oregon to preserve the memory&#8230; or something. I probably could have staged another picture for the blog that would have been &#8216;prettier&#8217; but this is more authentic! This is also the most skin I&#8217;ve ever shown breastfeeding (I think). I wanted to wear a dress to the beach in Oregon, and of course couldn&#8217;t lift it up or pull it down, so I had to take the entire shoulder off. Usually I wear strapless dresses so I can just pull them down on one side or I wear a tank-top under a shirt so I can pull one up and one down, leaving no skin exposed.</sub></p>
<p>In the beginning, I felt uncomfortable breastfeeding around certain people (especially my brothers). But do you know <em>why</em> I felt uncomfortable? Because they made comments about it that made me feel uncomfortable Comments like &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to see your boob, you&#8217;re family!&#8217; <em>Sigh.</em>&nbsp;Well, do you know what I ended up doing a few weeks after Clara was born? Feeding her in front of whoever was in my apartment. I mean, if people are going to visit a newborn, they should expect to see a newborn get fed and be changed and cry and do what newborns do. I was tired of leaving the room every time Clara wanted to eat, so I just fed her wherever I was when she started fussing. I wasn&#8217;t trying to make a point, but I was trying to act like a normal mom and human being in my own home, without feeling an ounce of shame about it.</p>
<p><strong>I assure you, no one has stopped visiting us because of my decision to breastfeed.</strong></p>
<p>I figure that if people don&#8217;t want to watch it, they can avert their eyes &#8211; and I generally try to be as discrete as I can be. When it comes to nursing Clara in front of my brothers (or Tim&#8217;s brother) I hope that instead of feeling awkward about me nursing their niece, they are learning a bit about the best way to feed a baby and will become breastfeeding advocates when they have children, and can then support their wives if they breastfeed &#8211; <em>especially in public.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I know that the more that women breastfeed in front of others, the more desensitized people will be to it, <strong>and the more supportive we can all be of moms and families.</strong> In other countries, breastfeeding is absolutely not seen as a big deal (no matter where it&#8217;s done) and the moms in those countries breastfeed way longer than we do here in America (which we knows benefits the babies). I can only assume that their breastfeeding relationships last longer because they feel supported by their community, but it also probably has something to do with their longer maternity leave.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my observations after about 3.5 months of breastfeeding in public:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve never had an awkward experience or a negative encounter.</li>
<li>It is much less distracting to feed a baby than it is to deal with a screaming baby because they&#8217;re hungry and aren&#8217;t getting fed fast enough (immediately).</li>
<li>The more I nurse in public, the easier it gets.</li>
<li>If I don&#8217;t act like it&#8217;s a big deal, no one else does either.</li>
<li>People have made very positive and kind comments to me while I&#8217;ve been nursing in public &#8211; including men.</li>
<li>Places I have fed Clara in public, without a cover, include: parks, gardens, benches in front of restaurants, an airport bar, airport gates, airplane seats, a vegan fest, in our car, in stores, at yoga class, at our mom/baby classes, at church and in my women&#8217;s small group at church&#8230; I mean pretty much any place I&#8217;ve gone in the last 3.5 months with Clara.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point of this post is this: I hope if you see a mom nursing her baby in public you recognize that breastfeeding can be difficult and this mom is actually taking the &#8216;hard road&#8217; when it comes to feeding her baby, and she&#8217;s doing it because she feels it&#8217;s important &#8211; she isn&#8217;t doing it to make you uncomfortable. I hope you react without shock or disgust. I hope that if your husband or kids or even other women around you have a reaction to it, you can gently remind them that boobs were made by God to feed babies and the women is just doing exactly that. Walking past a nursing mom and offering a &#8216;congrats&#8217; would be a wonderful thing to do, and I&#8217;d encourage you to do just that!</p>
<p>We should all be supportive of one another &#8211; but moms and women should&nbsp;<strong>definitely</strong> be supportive of other moms and women. And if you&#8217;re reading this and are afraid to nurse in public because you&#8217;re afraid of what other people will think or say &#8211; I think you should try it out! Only if you are comfortable doing so, but it&#8217;s amazing how liberating it feels to be able to feed your baby wherever you are without fumbling around for bottles or a cover.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
