		<description><![CDATA[We moved to Seattle because we wanted to, too! I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve been adjusting well! I also love and appreciate your attitude of &#039;well, if I still feel this way in a while, we&#039;ll just move back&#039; because that&#039;s the same thought process I had when we first moved here. Of course I&#039;m hoping we love it, but if not, we can always change our circumstances again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this post! We moved from AZ (my home) about 1 1/2 years ago to NC. We didn&#039;t move because of a job, we moved because we wanted to. I have to admit, I have LOVED living here!! However, ever since the holidays (so the last two weeks haha), I have been yearning for home. I miss my family, I miss my friends, and I get sad thinking my little girls won&#039;t be growing up near their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. It&#039;s weird because these feeling just recently set in. I guess we&#039;ll see what happens - either they&#039;ll go away or we&#039;ll move back if they don&#039;t, haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes! So true. Chicago feels like home because it&#039;s familiar, but it definitely doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s our home anymore. Seattle feels like our home but it&#039;s still unfamiliar to us... so strange!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand what you mean. House is not a home, nor is home a house. Home is where your heart is and that&#039;s in Chicago. It&#039;s okay to have these feelings, but we learn to accept it. Perhaps Seatlle can be a new home &#060;3

		<description><![CDATA[Gosh, good point. I think my childhood home will always be &#039;home&#039; and it will be weird when/if my mom eventually moves from it! Plus, when we go to Chicago we now go to the suburbs and not the city which is where Tim and I actually lived. Gosh, it&#039;s so complicated being an adult!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s definitely hard when you don&#039;t plan on truly settling in a place long term! I mean, I never felt like my college town was &#039;home&#039; because I knew I wouldn&#039;t be staying there longer than I had to. But I do love Seattle! (And we can&#039;t wait to hang out with you guys again SOON!)]]></description>
