		<description><![CDATA[SO TRUE. And she loves her footy pajamas and then she can&#039;t take them off. We&#039;re having an &#039;issue&#039; right now because Clara takes her shoes and socks off every time she&#039;s in the carseat or stroller, and then tosses them to the side. I&#039;ve had to go back and search the sidewalk multiple times over the last few days, because she throws them without me seeing and I keep walking!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At first it goes against your deductible but THEN it&#039;s completely free! At least that&#039;s how mine works because I have a high-deductible plan. Definitely check it out, though! Free massages!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I&#039;m so glad that you felt like a chiropractor helped! I went last time at 41+ weeks (yeah, I waited until the last minute) and promised myself this time I would go way earlier, to hopefully get my pelvis and hips looser so this  baby drops! Drop baby, drop!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[love that globe by amber! the only thing stopping me from ordering one is the COMPLETE lack of surface space in our home. and wall space somehow...also: i completely credit the chiropractor for my easy labor. i had terrible hip pain in the early third trimester, like could barely walk it was so bad. i started going to one regularly for the rest of my pregnancy, and not only did the hip pain go away, but i truly believe that i was able to labor and deliver with no issues (and quickly!) because i was all lined up. hope your discomfort goes away! and that the last weeks go by easily and quickly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES. I mean, they&#039;re covered once my deductible is met, but since this is a birth year, we&#039;ll definitely meet it so essentially they&#039;re FREE!! And I&#039;m taking full advantage :-)]]></description>
