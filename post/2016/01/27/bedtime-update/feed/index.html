		<description><![CDATA[Wowwwww.... I&#039;m so impressed with people who can go to bed before 10pm! No matter how early I wake up, I just can&#039;t do it. But I also wake up at 6am and not usually 5!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is so great! I&#039;ve decided on an 11pm bedtime too. And if I want to read in bed, I&#039;ll be in bed by 10:30. The idea is that I am completely asleep no later than 11:30.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I started having a bed time in the fall when I started grad school at the age of 27. It&#039;s 9:30 pm (though I&#039;m staying up late because we have a snow day).]]></description>

BUT if you know anyone who wants to visit you and you don&#039;t have space for them, send them our way! We have an entire apartment for guests!]]></description>
