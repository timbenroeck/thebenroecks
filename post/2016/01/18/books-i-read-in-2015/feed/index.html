		<description><![CDATA[Brain on Fire was hands down one of my favorites last year...as was Wild. :) We actually read a lot of similar things! My favorite so far this year has ben The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls. Have you read that?!  If not...definitely get your hands on a copy ASAP! It&#039;s a gripping memoir!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any favorites from your list I should dig into this year?! The Shack actually wasn&#039;t one of my absolute favorite books, but I did think it offered a really valuable perspective about the different characters of God and the importance of a personal relationship with Him!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My goal was to read 30 and I think I did 28 (13 of the books were 700-1000 page novels so I forgive myself for not technically reaching my goal). The Shack is one of my favorite books - it&#039;s really the book that helped develop my faith into real faith, whereas before &quot;believing in God&quot; was just something I said rather than something I practiced. Great list!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though you didn&#039;t read one book a week you certainly read some great ones. 33 books in a year is definitely still an accomplishment as a busy mom who moved across the country!]]></description>
