		<description><![CDATA[See, counting backwards from a wakeup time never works well for me because I just think &#039;oh whatever, I&#039;ll just get less sleep or maybe I&#039;ll sleep in just a bit longer.&#039; I do better with ABSOLUTE rules that I can stick to every single night no matter what. For some reason it just makes it easier for me!


I think what you said about keeping yourself awake has been SO true for me. I find myself aimlessly scrolling my phone or reading more chapters of a book that I&#039;m not REALLY focused on to probably stay awake instead of allowing myself to relax and go to sleep. It&#039;s been a goal of mine to journal before I go to sleep to avoid this very thing. You&#039;re always 5 steps ahead of me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gosh, I wish I could wake up at 5:30 to workout but it&#039;s dark here until 8 and I just CANNOT workout before it gets light out. Bleh. I&#039;m a morning person wannabe but it&#039;s just not happening!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, I should. I&#039;m not so great at actually making it to bed. I tend to see how many projects I can get done in whatever amount of time I think I have left before I should be in bed and then I look and it&#039;s super late and I&#039;m not asleep. Especially now that Joe goes to bed so early because he&#039;s an old fart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok, so i can&#039;t make it to 930 pm. literally, i&#039;m lightly snoring and in deep REM sleep by 1030... but i also wake up to run every morning at 5:30... so maybe that&#039;s it? i&#039;m a morning person, so bed times have never been an issue for me... which is sort of pathetic when i&#039;m yawning at 8:15 on a friday night. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally have a bedtime. It has to switch every month - and sometimes every day - because of my crazy work schedule. But I feel awful physically and emotionally if I don&#039;t get at least 7 hrs of solid sleep, so I always plan ahead to figure out how I&#039;ll get those 7 hrs, even though it often requires some creativity and effort.

I used to think I &quot;wasn&#039;t tired enough&quot; to fall asleep early, then I realized that I was keeping myself up by doing things that were stimulating (I realized this while I was telling parents not to stimulate their baby at night if they wanted the baby to sleep!). It wasn&#039;t that I wasn&#039;t tired, I was just keeping myself awake. Sometimes I still do that, but I&#039;ve realized when I do, it&#039;s usually because there&#039;s something bothering me that I haven&#039;t sorted out yet. So I&#039;m reading random articles to avoid just lying alone with myself. Now for myself, if I get that feeling of being &quot;sucked in&quot;, I try to figure out what I&#039;m avoiding and write it out or talk it out. Has helped immensely in many parts of my life!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You strike me as someone who would definitely have a bedtime! I&#039;m always admiring how structured and scheduled you are! Right now it&#039;s 10:40 so I have to get my butt in gear if I&#039;m going to be asleep in 20 minutes - yikes!]]></description>
