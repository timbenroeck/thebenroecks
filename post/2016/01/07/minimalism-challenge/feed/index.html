		<description><![CDATA[100 things is way easier than you think! Well, I guess if it&#039;s 100 BIG things that&#039;s different, but in my case, my bathroom closet alone was filled with so many half-used containers of things I was never going to use again that I could have gotten to 100 in no time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! Previously I&#039;ve been in the habit of keeping things in piles and then EVENTUALLY moving them out of the house, but it would take me forever. During this challenge I got it all out of the house immediately and it made me feel so much better!]]></description>
