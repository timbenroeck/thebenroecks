		<description><![CDATA[I love that you got up to the mountains! Snowshoeing is on my list of things to try sooner rather than later, never done it. We have lots of great mountains and tons of great hikes though and they&#039;re all so close!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you&#039;re loving the milder winters here. Since I grew up in Washington I am such a baby about cold winters, I always say I could never live someplace like Chicago because I already hate the winter here so much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That photos in that last link you posted are so powerful. Sometimes when I&#039;m on the El, I like to look around at everyone else and see how many people are on their phones. It&#039;s mind-boggling: sometimes when I do that, I&#039;m one of only a couple of people not on my phone, out of all the people in the car. What&#039;s even crazier to think is that six, seven, eight years ago, it wouldn&#039;t have been like that at all! Everyone would&#039;ve been listening to their iPod, of course, but smartphones were still so new then that I bet maybe only half of the people on the train even had smart phones. It&#039;s pretty nuts to think that there&#039;s been that huge of a cultural shift in so short of time.]]></description>
