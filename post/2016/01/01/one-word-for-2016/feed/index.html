		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Sharlee! And yikes, a two year old! Are you prepared for a true toddler?! I&#039;m really excited to see how Clara grows in these next 6 months, but am also terrified because she&#039;s already an opinionated little one! That&#039;s why I&#039;m really going to work on embracing where we are in this journey, no matter what transitions and challenges lie ahead. One thing I didn&#039;t anticipate about motherhood is how many different phases and feelings there are as a baby continues to develop and grow!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome word choice! I love that you are dedicated to living well--what an inspiring post to read. As a new(ish) mom (my daughter will turn 2 this month) I can tell you that your word choice is great. If you can embrace it all--you will find yourself so much happier. Everything is honestly for a season in motherhood--embrace it. There&#039;s challenging and joyful in all of it. I wish you luck! I also hope you&#039;ll continue to link up with us to keep us updated!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear ya on the saying no thing! Being a mom has definitely helped slow down my life a lot in most areas, but it&#039;s still hard for me to figure out what I should say yes or no to. And I agree, this should be a fun year but I just hope I don&#039;t get frustrated with the changes and instead learn to embrace wherever I am in life!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a great word! My word is present. Being present right now. Not thinking about the future or worrying about the past. It sort of incorporates your words from this year and last!]]></description>
