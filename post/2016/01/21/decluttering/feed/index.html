		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh if it&#039;s in the garage just move it to Goodwill! That seems like an easy enough transition, but I totally understand the guilt. It&#039;s hard when you&#039;re dealing with people whose love language is gift giving. Just remember that they felt the joy and love when giving the gift and you felt it when receiving the gift... but that doesn&#039;t mean you need to hold onto it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha I&#039;m pretty sure my job IS taking care of my kid and making my house more awesome and somehow I still don&#039;t have the time/energy to do it all! It&#039;s a slow process, but it&#039;s coming together!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh the gift guilt...my mother in law, bless her. She works at K-Mart and purchases things when they go super on sale. She buys year round and stocks up for Christmas so we&#039;re always getting way too many things. In the 8 years that I&#039;ve been getting gifts from her, I&#039;ve used maybe 15 things out of probably 100 individual items. I&#039;ve got boxes of stuff she&#039;s given just sitting in the garage because I have no use for it but feel bad getting rid of it. We&#039;ve tried telling her that we don&#039;t need so much stuff and that we&#039;d rather her spend the same amount of money on something more substantial, but it hasn&#039;t worked yet. I hope I&#039;m not coming off as ungrateful, but I just wish she&#039;d listen because the clutter stresses me out sometimes.]]></description>
