		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I never thought about bringing a pregnancy pillow! I wonder if mine would even fit in a hospital bed... I hear ya about the makeup. I&#039;m totally putting it on every day this time while we&#039;re in the hospital and even afterwards. There are some VERY unflattering pics of me and Clara when she was a few days old!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES to the travel bag ahead of time. I always keep a little bag full of travel-sized items in my closet so I can throw it in my suitcase for any trip... but it works well in this scenario, too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha I love it! Like he would know if you were in labor or not ;-) I wouldn&#039;t trust Tim to pack for me without a list... he would be way too flustered if I was in labor!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really feel like I didn&#039;t pack anything at all with Clara, but this list looks pretty long! Good call on something that zips up, I wouldn&#039;t have thought of it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t know why, but I&#039;m addicted to seeing what people pack in their bags. it&#039;s just so fun to see what everyone wants/needs with them. my one thing that was so useful last time (that I never thought would be) was my zip up hoodie. it was more &quot;dressed up&quot; than my robe, but still easy to take on and off for visitors and nursing. so weird to think you&#039;ll need one again soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have packed my bag already...but I keep thinking of things I want to add, that I actively use! So I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be throwing some last minute things in there. I also only live like 10 minutes from the hospital so I can always make my brother or sister-in-law (who live like 3 blocks away) go pick things up for me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris ended up packing my bag as I was having contractions and swearing I wasn&#039;t in labor yet haha. He packed it in about 3 minutes flat and I didn&#039;t come across anything we needed that was missing!]]></description>
