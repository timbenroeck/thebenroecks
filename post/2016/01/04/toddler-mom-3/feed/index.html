		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Now that I&#8217;m the mom to an exuberant toddler, I&#8217;m still figuring out what being Clara&#8217;s mother looks like. It looks different in every stage of her life. Being a newborn mom is different than being a mom to an infant and once Clara started moving&#8230; well, it was a whole new ballgame to adjust to. And now I have the &#8216;terrible twos&#8217; and the lovely three year old stages to look forward to, but I know I shouldn&#8217;t get ahead of myself! I really am enjoying the stage we&#8217;re in right now. [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a mom yet, but this was really encouraging! It&#039;s refreshing to hear your honest perspective about motherhood and pregnancy. Good to know for the future :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Clara is always going to be a bit slower of a communicator, because she was physically really ahead of things and her little mind can only give so much energy to anything other than climbing on things and destroying our house. Hahahah! But it seriously has helped SO MUCH that she is able to say &#039;yeah&#039;. It&#039;s amazing how much easier it is to keep us both happy during our days!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhh maybe I need to be even more brutally honest then ;-) Hahaha motherhood is definitely always a joy even in it&#039;s worst moments, because no matter what it&#039;s about a little person I love with all of my heart! But I still feel like I&#039;m going crazy 70% of my days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YESSSSS THE TALKING SAVES EVERYTHING! Amelia (thankfully for my sanity) started early, which was great because girlfriend has preferences like clara. and once she was able to get where she wanted to go and tell me what she wanted, crying decreased by 80%. we still have tantrums obviously, but they are fewer and less intense, because on some level she can understand the boundaries. so glad that you are feeling better about all this. and can&#039;t wait for you to get that baby!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I FEEL YOU. It&#039;s still so frustrating but babies change a ton between 12-18 months, it turns out! I&#039;m hoping these next few months get easier before we &#039;officially&#039; reach the terrible twos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this post!!! Joe this weekend kept yelling back to Bensen, &quot;What are you trying to tell me?!?!?&quot; Usually I can read his cues and know when he&#039;s tired, hungry, uncomfortable or whatever else, but being able to fully communicate with him would be amazing! But really, this post was perfect and made me so happy that Bensen is still growing up, even though I miss my snuggly little newborn sometimes.]]></description>
