		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve gotten rid of a lot of things and added some good pieces. The other day I bought new jeans, two sizes smaller than what I was wearing, and that has felt fantastic!!! haha. I didn&#039;t cry during any of the episodes. I expected to cry during last week&#039;s because Mandy and Milo said it was an intense episode for them to watch, but nothing...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! Caffeine used to REALLY affect me but now it doesn&#039;t... I guess my body must be used to it! Granted, I only drink one cup a day... but still, even that used to REALLY make a difference and now I don&#039;t even notice except if I don&#039;t drink it I get sick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I are both hooked, of course. It&#039;s such a good show! Any suggestions on weaning from coffee/caffeine?! I should probably look at caffeine content and try to go for drinks with less and less every few weeks or so... any other tips?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing the same thing with my wardrobe lately, getting rid of stuff I don&#039;t love to wear and replacing it with pieces that are versatile!
I&#039;m still trying to decide how I feel about This is Us. I can&#039;t decide if I love it or not yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched the first few episodes of This Is Us because everyone was talking about it and I just feel &quot;meh&quot; about the whole thing. It&#039;s been entertaining enough to watch while I&#039;m on the treadmill or killing some time, but I&#039;m not all OMG THIS IS AMAZING like so many people seem to be. Also, is that a BFing phase because maybe that&#039;s what&#039;s going on with me too?! lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I rarely cry while watching movies or tv shows (other than the Leftovers) but this is us has me in tears every episode. But I can&#039;t stop watching because it so good!
I&#039;m with you on the coffee! I have a serious problem with spending money in lattes so I&#039;ve limited myself to only going out on the weekends and maybe one weekday if it&#039;s a particularly stressful day. I can drink 3 cups a day and still pass out on the couch at 10. My husband thinks I&#039;m crazy. 
Also your nails are amazing, love that color!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cried during the first episode of This is Us! My husband thought I was a crazy person so I made him watch the show with me and now he is hooked too. 

Also... the coffee addiction is a real thing and I did not believe it until it happened to me. When I found out I was prego I went cold turkey and that was the biggest mistake of my life. I transitioned to tea and that really really helped... but now that I am past the first trimester I am back on the juice (1 cup a day max) and loving love. I know its not the best, but I just LOVE it.]]></description>
