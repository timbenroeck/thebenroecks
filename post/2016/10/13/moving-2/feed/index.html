		<description><![CDATA[Glad that you are settling in and liking your new place!! Hope that you will have plenty of peace and quiet without the super-loud construction so close. Also... I agree re: movers. So worth it, they get everything done more quickly/efficiently/safely. Are you guys still planning to Airbnb?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so jealous that you hired movers. We are in the process of self-moving to a new house only a couple blocks away but it&#039;s such an ordeal. Your new house sounds great though! Isn&#039;t it so nice when you find a place that works just right. I am super excited about the walk in closet and a bigger kitchen in our new place.]]></description>
