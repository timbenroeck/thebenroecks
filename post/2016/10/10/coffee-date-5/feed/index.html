		<description><![CDATA[Oh my GOSH how about that game last night?!!!! I was at a bar doing trivia with friends and could barely pay attention since I was watching the game, but we left when it was still the 8th inning, so I missed the actual action, but the people upstairs were more than happy to keep us informed of the details with their cheers. My favorite part was when they started singing Go Cubs Go after they won. Man do I love Chicago right now. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll cry if they win it all.

You are a genius, hiring movers and packers. I&#039;ll never move without movers again, but I&#039;ve never tried packers. Maybe the next time I move.... There are few things in life I hate more than packing.

I haven&#039;t watched any of the debates this year, which kind of makes me feel like a bad citizen, but I just cannot with Trump, so I don&#039;t even watch. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m undecided, and I know watching is just going to make me either want to throw my TV out a window or jump off a cliff, so I don&#039;t watch. And if that makes me uninformed, so be it. Better that than ragingly angry! Haha :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go Cubs!  I hope they win..mostly because I work with a lot of people in Cleveland and they would be SO annoying if they won another championship this year :)  Good luck with moving!  We&#039;ve never hired movers, but that&#039;s because we&#039;re really cheap (and maybe slightly crazy) but do whatever works for you!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[UGH. Amen about the debate and all involved.

I love packing things up and moving. I think I&#039;m the only weirdo that actually enjoys it. Haha! So far I&#039;ve moved dorms and apartments, but Ivem never packed up a house so maybe I&#039;d change my mind in the midst of that task ;)

I&#039;m glad Clara likes swimming! It&#039;s such a good skill to know!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve already told Jared that whenever we move we MUST hire professionals. We have helped so many other family members and friends move in the past few years that I&#039;m just NOT up for doing our own haha. So happy to hear you&#039;re getting some sleep and enjoying Tim&#039;s paternity leave :) Off to make my second cup of coffee + caramel creamer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great coffee date! Yay for moving! I just recently did the &quot;get rid of everything in my closet&quot; gig and I discovered ThredUp and Poshmark, which will pay you for your unwanted clothing...it&#039;s the best! We watched the debate last night and....oy vey. It was rough. I think I&#039;m going to check out from politics for a while..too much negativity. Finally, YAY BASEBALL! I am such a baseball girl. I&#039;m a die hard Orioles fan, but after they lost the Wild Card, my next team was the Cubs (even though my hubby is a Giants fan!) I just really want the Cubs to win it. If the O&#039;s can&#039;t have it, I feel like the Cubs should! They&#039;ve had such a hot year, and they haven&#039;t won a WS in such a long time! Go Cubs!]]></description>
