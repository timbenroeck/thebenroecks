		<description><![CDATA[The darker earlier thing and cooler weather thing is something I&#039;m dreading. It&#039;s hard for me to take Emmy out when it&#039;s cold and Bensen LOVES to be outside, so when I&#039;m home with them during the day, it will be a challenge. We usually go out and play when Joe gets home, but the earlier it gets dark, the more that&#039;s not possible :(
Also, I&#039;m with you on the babysitter thing. For now, when we go on our babies free date night, we&#039;re having our parents or Joe&#039;s sister come over and watch the kiddos but I keep asking myself at what point do I feel comfortable having my niece handle both kids?!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, I am SO happy you tried leaving both girls with the babysitter AND that it went well! I told you it&#039;d be fine! high school babysitters are weirdly good at their jobs, I think it&#039;s youth. wasted on the young. also, how dare you show me jeans right now? I kid you not I barely fit in my leggings right now...]]></description>
