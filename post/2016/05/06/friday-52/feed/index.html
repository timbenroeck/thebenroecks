I didn&#039;t comment on your last post, but let me say, you are keeping me feeling like I can do this two kids thing. like it&#039;s not as scary as it seems in my head. as for cleaning products: honestly, my mom swears by various combos of white vinegar/water/other kitchen products. I love cleaning my windows with vinegar, water and cornstarch. I usually put some essential oils in there to cut the vinegar smell. if you aren&#039;t into that idea, the mrs. meyers and seventh generation lines are awesome and you can get them at target.]]></description>
