		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s MOPS groups all around me within an hour radius, but none here. Probably because it&#039;s a college town haha. I&#039;ll have to ask around at church to see if there&#039;s any groups I don&#039;t know about. I&#039;ve thought about starting one, but it terrifies me! I&#039;m sure with a congregation near 1,000 I&#039;m not the only SAHM :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well even if you have more time, you&#039;ll also have a toddler AND a newborn, so you&#039;ll probably feel like you actually don&#039;t have any more time to dedicate to the newborn! I don&#039;t mean that negatively, I just mean that you&#039;ll probably still be very laid back and awesome the second time around, too! I&#039;ll be sending you good breastfeeding vibes - you can do it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh that is HARD. I meet moms at MOPS and through church groups. We&#039;re part of a small group that is comprised of all young families, so that has made it easy. In Chicago I was also a part of a moms church group and small group of young families. Are there Facebook groups for moms in your area? Does your church have small groups that meet during the week? Honestly, if they don&#039;t have a moms group that meets during the week, maybe this is a great opportunity to organize one! I know that probably sounds intimidating, but it just involves getting a group together, picking out a book or study to read through, and inviting moms in! I&#039;m sure you aren&#039;t the only person in your community who would love to meet other moms!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How did you meet your mom friends? I&#039;m a SAHM in a city that I moved to 2.5 years ago so I don&#039;t have any friends from home or any work friends. I go to a church with around 1,000 members and only know a handful of those people, and they all have older kids and work outside the home. There&#039;s no MOPS groups or any other mommy groups that I&#039;ve been able to find. I would love to have a mommy friend community!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love this perspective! I feel like I might be less laid back with this kid because I actually have time. With Bensen, I never read books, but I&#039;m in the middle of my second right now... I mean, I&#039;ve done this once, how difficult could it be, right?! Unless my baby isn&#039;t a good sleeper... The thing I&#039;m most worried about is breastfeeding, since I never really actually did that with Bensen, I&#039;m thinking about all of my wardrobe and trying to figure out how that&#039;s going to work with this new little one.]]></description>
