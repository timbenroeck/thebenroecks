Bensen wasn&#039;t that big until he was a couple months old I think... or 3?? I guess though, your birth and my birth were different... if I&#039;d done it your way, that wouldn&#039;t sound quite as daunting for some reason, if you know what I mean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry about the difficult labor, but it is so nice to hear (see?) you say that it was all so rewarding in the end. Take it as easy as you can and love on those two little girls. Congrats, Mama!]]></description>
