		<description><![CDATA[The Cubs winning... Trump winning... my brain cannot even handle it. Still. I&#039;m just sad that Trump overshadowed the Cubs victory. I still can&#039;t tell how the country is ultimately going to handle his presidency because so far it&#039;s been such a sh*t show, but I&#039;m trying to be optimistic!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES. We have to be beacons of light and hope in our everyday lives and then there is no room for darkness within that. I mean, there might be darkness around us, but if we all light up our own lives in meaningful ways, that&#039;s a huge step to eliminating hate and fear. &#060;3 I&#039;m glad there are people like you in the world doing the right thing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh we&#039;ll see. They&#039;re definitely strong and independent and we&#039;ll work on respectful later. ;-)  Thanks for the encouragement! Being a mom doesn&#039;t feel super important most days but then I look at our country and remember it is the MOST important because we&#039;re truly raising our future and I can impact it even at home!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really hope that future generations will be even more tolerant and more accepting of differences than we are. I truly believe they will be. And I also believe that because of this they will love one another better and look back at us and think &quot;what on earth were you guys thinking?&quot; This gives me hope.  &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#060;3 &#060;3 &#060;3 Continuing with the theme of &#034;Moments I will Never Forget That Occurred in the Week of Nov. 2-8,&#034; Tuesday night/Wednesday also definitely fit that bill (though for the COMPLETE opposite reason as the Cubs celebrations.). The only encouragement I take from all of this is that Trump winning seemed to motivate a lot of people to want to do everything in their power to work to correct so many of the hateful forces that formed the hallmarks of his campaign - the racism, the sexism, the homophobia, the xenophobia, et. al. I&#039;m hopeful that this will push many people to come together and focus on similarities rather than differences, and work to push out hatred and replace it with love, compassion and understanding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I keep thinking is if we all go to work today and are not racist, are not misogynistic, do not support rape culture around us, and treat our friends and neighbors as our equals REGARDLESS of gender or religion or race or sexual orientation...then hate does not win. And we just have to keep doing that Every. Single. Day.]]></description>
