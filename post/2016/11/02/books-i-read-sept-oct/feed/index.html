		<description><![CDATA[I actually haven&#039;t read Tina Fey&#039;s book... so that one is better? Adding it to my list now. I totally remember that part in The Interestings. It stuck with me. There were a few lines of that book that were surprisingly deep and I think that&#039;s why I liked it so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree re: Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me... I loved Tina Fey&#039;/ book and I wanted to love these other comedian books too, but they just left me feeling a bit meh. Amy Poehler is up there on my list of favorite celebrities, but I liked the stories about her in Tina Fey&#039;s book better than her own book!!

I keep thinking about that part in The Interestings that talk about how Ethan has a hard time relating to and coping with his son because he&#039;s afraid his son will make the things about himself that he&#039;s tried to hide become public and obvious... thought that was absolutely brilliant.]]></description>
