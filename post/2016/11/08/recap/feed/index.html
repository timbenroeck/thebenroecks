I think there is one polling place that was open on election day in all of Seattle, but I can&#039;t imagine how busy that must have been. It really, really was nice to have voting be so easy and accessible. I bet eventually the whole country will adopt that system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES pictures outside are so hard. The last time we tried it (when Clara was about 18 months) she had a tantrum because I wouldn&#039;t let her jump into the pond to chase ducks. Did you at least get some good ones of Bensen!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You all vote by mail?! That&#039;s awesome! Oh man, I love that. That&#039;s so great for making voting accessible to everyone. I mean, I&#039;m not surprised - usually the more liberal a state is, the more they work to make sure everyone has an easy time voting - but still, that&#039;s really, really awesome. Yet another reason to add to my list of reasons why Washington &#062; everywhere else. Haha.


Oh my gosh, last Wednesday. What. A. Day. Well, what a night, more accurately, but you get what I mean. I think that will go down as one of my favorite memories of all time - definitely top 10, for sure.


I totally understand about the library books. I can NEVER get through mine before they&#039;re due, but the thought of not returning them on time makes me so uncomfortable haha. I&#039;m a serial book renewer (I actually just renewed one book a couple minutes ago for the third time...), but they only let you do that if no one else wants the book, so if you&#039;re reading waitlisted books, that probably isn&#039;t an option :(]]></description>
