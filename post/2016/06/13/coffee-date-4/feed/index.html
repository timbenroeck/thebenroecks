		<description><![CDATA[Ohmygosh you just reminded me how much I love cauliflower bites! I haven&#039;t tried the buffalo variety, but Pioneer Woman has a great recipe for something similar. I&#039;m checking out your Pinterest board for sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, I REALLY hope your next one naps. Isabelle is giving me some long stretches of sleep at night but not during the day and she&#039;s so darn fussy when she&#039;s awake! She&#039;s actually my most difficult newborn by far, but Clara is now a difficult toddler so maybe there&#039;s hope that Isabelle will be easier in the future...?! I don&#039;t even know what I&#039;m typing anymore, Clara was up all night with 80 bijillion fictional emergencies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am going to need to search your Pinterest page for it for sure!! Tim is a reluctant vegetarian at home since we don&#039;t cook with meat, so if Jason loves it, I&#039;m hopeful! Also, my family has a Bachelorette fantasy league too so I feel you. I have Chase, Jordan, and Derek left out of my initial 5 contestants. I love Luke the most, though. And I must admit I&#039;m not a big fan of Alex... He just rubs me the wrong way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree! Although, looking at the weather forecast I think it&#039;s becoming summer again :-) I&#039;m a big fan of temps in the 60s and 70s! You should totally still read the book, especially if you want kids one day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ummmm of course I do! He cracks me up! Plus he has the sexiest evil smile. I mean, I feel kind of bad if any lady actually ends up with him, but I love him on my TV! I&#039;m all about Luke now, though. I think Wells is going home next episode - even though I like him, too.]]></description>
