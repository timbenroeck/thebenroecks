		<description><![CDATA[I love Aaron, too. Except I&#039;m a Bears fan so I can&#039;t admit that :-) I&#039;m still on the fence about Jordan, though... I don&#039;t think him and JoJo would actually end up together even if they got engaged on the show.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;but I canâ€™t help but still think that JoJoâ€™s cast of men leaves a lot to be desired.&quot; YES. I have been so underwhelmed by this season&#039;s dudes. I mean, I&#039;m still watching it until the bitter end, of course, but there truly isn&#039;t a single guy who&#039;s got my emotional investment (unlike last season, when I was SUPER invested in Jared). I&#039;ve watched the whole season, and it really wasn&#039;t until last week or so that I was finally able to confidently identify who&#039;s who, because all of these Brosephs look exactly like each other - like all of them are a paint-by-the-numbers classically beautiful men. And seriously, the bickering - it&#039;s like watching Mean Girls, except these are, allegedly, grown ass adults. Barely anyone seems to have an original thought in their head that didn&#039;t come straight out of A Bro&#039;s Guide to Being a Bro, Bro, and UGH. They just make me so ragey. James doesn&#039;t stand a chance because he clearly *didn&#039;t* read A Bro&#039;s Guide to Being a Bro, Bro, and neither did Wells, or Evan (who I wasn&#039;t rooting for, to be clear, but at least he was DIFFERENT. And isn&#039;t someone I&#039;d expect to run across on an Abercrombie bag.). Sigh. This stupid show. I&#039;m too addicted to the drama rush to quit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still have to watch the second half of the episode tonight, if Bensen decides to go to sleep.... (all three of my children are doing me in this week and Joe is gone to scout camp so I&#039;m a very tired momma), but I&#039;ve just been feeling like these guys are all so catty. I think Joe said that a few seasons ago, when it was a Bachelorette one. He came in one night while I was watching and said that there was more drama than there would be with girls haha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did see the episode and I had a lot of the same thoughts! I&#039;m very much team Jordan, mostly because I&#039;m a HUGE fan of his brother so I feel like I have to love him. ;) I&#039;m really not a fan of James - he&#039;s a great guy, but not confident enough, especially for JoJo in my opinion. He&#039;d annoy the crap out of me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I just jumped on the bandwagon this season after not understanding why anyone would ever watch- and now I totally get it. Totally agree with Wells&#039; date being cringe-worthy, I was SO uncomfortable. Imagine that slip and slide with pretty much any other guy, it would have been so sexy. Instead it was just odd. And totally agree that Luke should just win now. He&#039;s sweet, interesting, and the passion is UN-REAL (as JoJo says). Did you see how he was grabbing her thigh when they were making out though? Ok, I&#039;m done, I just lost at least 12 brain cells and now have to classify myself as a creepy cougar.]]></description>
