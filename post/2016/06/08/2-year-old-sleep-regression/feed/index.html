		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s had his moments that seem rough to us, but when I hear other people&#039;s stories, I realize that we&#039;re lucky. Most of his sleep problems come when he&#039;s sick, teething or earlier on when he had started rolling in his sleep or would lose his binky and wake up but couldn&#039;t find it or put it back in himself. :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh there is! I wouldn&#039;t lie to you about such things. Although I think it&#039;s more because of all of the changes 2 year olds tend to be going through (molars, new sibs, potty training, climbing out of their crib, night terrors...) than any full on regression. It hasn&#039;t been fun over here, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh the life of a two year old!!! We are still lucky that Bensen sleeps so well, especially at night. I lay him down and he&#039;s quiet from the time I shut his door until he wakes up the next morning (unless he stirs a bit). Last night though, I went in to put something in his room before I went to bed (I&#039;m a risk taker) and both of his binkies (I keep one on the edge of the crib so if he loses the one and for some reason wakes up in the middle of the night, I don&#039;t have to crawl on the floor searching for it), were clear across the room in front of his closet. So apparently he was just quietly causing chaos in his room after I put him down.

Last week was rough though when I stayed at home because he&#039;d cry for 30 seconds every time I laid him down for a nap. I think he just wanted to play. I&#039;m crossing my fingers and praying that our second baby is a good sleeper and that Bensen doesn&#039;t hit a weird sleep stage because he&#039;s been so good for so long, even with his molars coming in!

You&#039;re a champ! I&#039;ve loved reading all of these posts!]]></description>
