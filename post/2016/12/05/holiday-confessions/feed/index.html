		<description><![CDATA[I love posts like these! I have never done Christmas cards but every year I say I want to. I love getting cards from my friends and family; we keep all of them on our fridge which has gotten pretty crowded but I never throw them away!

Yes, telling them that Santa is always watching them is pretty creepy. I don&#039;t remember ever thinking Santa was watching me as a kid. I don&#039;t remember believing he was real, either, but we still left cookies and milk out for him.

I love white lights too. And I think the amount of ornaments I put on our tree makes up for your lack of ornaments. It&#039;s like Christmas balls threw up on my tree AND I LOVE IT.

Speaking of tree, we didn&#039;t get ours until Friday the 9th, and I&#039;m still sad we had to wait so long. From now on I&#039;m getting a tree the weekend of Thanksgiving!

I have to stop now. The end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay-the holiday flat white is AMAZING! the best drink of the year! also, I am not getting any young kids gifts in our family, and my mom was shocked! my explanation is that the parents are WAY more deserving for being amazing parents! who cares if you don&#039;t get any presents for a baby, the holidays are way more about family and the magic!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re both AMAZING MOMS, obvi. Clara already has so many gifts from grandparents (sent already!) that I&#039;m debating how to spread them out so she doesn&#039;t get too many at once and forget about them all immediately. Sigh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another confession... I think we had 75 people at Clara&#039;s first birthday party. Don&#039;t judge me too harshly! It was a super casual backyard party that I did approx 30 minutes of prepping for and I don&#039;t even know how it happened but it was so much fun! For me! I think you need to change your mindset from &#039;child&#039;s first birthday party&#039; to &#039;parents celebration of survival for a year&#039;, because those parties are all about the parents.]]></description>
