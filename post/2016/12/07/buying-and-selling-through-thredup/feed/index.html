		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve not tried ThredUp before but I&#039;ve heard of it and now I will look into it! I had no clue you could send in your clothes, that&#039;s awesome! Even if they just end up donating them... donating is what I would want to do anyway!

Side note, my sister sells her daughters&#039; clothes on IG &quot;@raising_daughtersshop&quot; and I think her girls are right around Isabella and Clara&#039;s ages. Have you ever thought about selling anything on IG? Apparently it can be pretty lucrative! Or, if you are just shopping, you can find some really good deals!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh you should go back and see if they have anything! I bet a lot of people are going to clean out their closest for the new year so I&#039;m hoping to snag some great stuff when that happens!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I purchased something from ThredUp once but never took things beyond that one purchase. I still get emails from them though so maybe after the holiday madness I&#039;ll revisit the site and revamp my closet. (I never buy name brand stuff, so I doubt they&#039;d take of my never/gently worn clothes. Haha.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I moved a few years ago, I got rid of a LOT of stuff and thought about trying to sell some of it to thredUP to see if I could help offset my moving costs at all. I have so few brand name clothes though that I ended up figuring it&#039;d be easier to just go to the Salvation Army a couple blocks away and donate everything instead haha. But I love the concept - I&#039;m sure it&#039;s particularly useful for people living in areas without an abundance of consignment stores (or even for someone like you who just hasn&#039;t found the perfect one yet!).]]></description>
