		<description><![CDATA[You know, I really don&#039;t have any great book suggestions for parenting! &#039;The Happiest Baby on the Block&#039; has good suggestions, but you don&#039;t need to read the book since it&#039;s all online and in YouTube videos. I also read &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; which I thought was helpful when you may be thinking about sleep training - although I took advice from a lot of different sources. I highly recommend Janet Lansbury books and articles! She has a blog that I love. I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s as relevant for the newborn stage, but it will give you a lot to think about as a parent in general! Basically, my advice is always to figure out what kind of parent you are and what resonates with you, and read books and articles by people with the same (or similar) perspectives. If I read any good ones going forward, I&#039;ll let you know!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW! I&#039;m not very Type A about most things, but it really does blow my mind that labor can just start without planning and preparation or really anything at all. It just happens! (Well, supposedly. I was induced last time so it didn&#039;t just happen, but this time I just know it will!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of doing the Vitamin K show while holding Baby Beni! Even though I hate hate hate watching Clara get vaccines, I think I&#039;d feel better being there for it. I wasn&#039;t able to be with Clara for any of her procedures and she was hooked up to all sorts of needles and monitors, so if all we&#039;re dealing with is one vaccine for Beni, I&#039;ll take it! I&#039;m really hoping we get to do skin-to-skin right away, too. That would be a big win for me! I think our hospital is really progressive / baby-friendly so I&#039;m feeling really good that a lot of our &#039;wishes&#039; are already protocols and not things I necessarily need to ask for, but I still think it&#039;s nice to have it all written down just in case! I&#039;m definitely going to add a line item saying I&#039;d like to do skin-to-skin for newborn procedures if possible. I&#039;ll probably be texting you more questions as I think of them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this, it reminds me so much of what our birth preferences were for Amelia. we wrote a little letter like this to leave in our room and with the nurses. we even added a little blurb at the end that said, &quot;while we would love to have our preferences followed, we understand that no plan ever happens exactly like you think it will. our main goal is for a healthy baby and mom at the end and are open to a new direction if needed for that reason.&quot; I think it made the nurses feel better, like we understood that sometimes things happen that are out of your control, we weren&#039;t just crazy parents who wanted what we wanted and thought we knew better than the nurses. 
also, I echo what a couple people have said. our hospital did all the aftercare (vitamin k shot, erythromycin, etc.) while I was holding Amelia. they didn&#039;t even weigh or measure her until i had done skin to skin and nursing for almost two hours, and he had done skin to skin while i cleaned up. we did both vaccines with Amelia (we may change our mind on the hep B with the next one), and she had no reaction, which i think was due to me holding her while they happened. if your hospital is baby-friendly, that may just be protocol, but you can also ask for that as well. 
I&#039;m so excited for you...I&#039;m praying for an outcome that you want, and the strength to get through anything that happens!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you. Clara got whisked away to the NICU right away so I honestly didn&#039;t have any choices at all with the c-section or procedures afterwards, other than to deny certain things. We didn&#039;t get to do skin-to-skin until hours after her birth, which makes me really sad! I&#039;m definitely hoping for a different experience this time, even if we still end up in a c-section situation. I think it&#039;s great that hospitals are trying to make c-sections more &#039;friendly&#039; so that moms can bond with their baby right away!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you! I think it&#039;s great to have preferences and an ideal scenario, but with some conditions you just can&#039;t plan a whole lot! I&#039;m being optimistic this time around, though!]]></description>
