		<description><![CDATA[Ughhhh it makes me feel better that I&#039;m not the only one with a pregnant license pic! Is yours at least a decent pic of you!? I look a little nuts (well, I look like a 40 week pregnant mom of a toddler who doesn&#039;t bother to do her hair and makeup). Oh, memories.  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really have no excuse for NOT getting a new license right when we moved, but it was one of those pesky errands I just kept putting off, not realizing the problem until it was too late! I had no idea IL licenses all expire on your 30th bday, even if you just got it renewed right before then. So frustrating!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RIGHT?! I can&#039;t believe the DMV is so inefficient still. And I had to go do a driving school to take the knowledge and the skills portion, so that&#039;s FOUR DAYS I spent at these various locations to get this all figured out. AND I CAN&#039;T DRINK WINE!!!!!! Ok, rant over. It&#039;s done ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RIGHT?! Washington has a grace period of a few months (if not longer) and so does Illinois (so it would have  been easy to renew if I had either one of those licenses and was still in the state), but transferring between states with an expired license is the tricky part. I just couldn&#039;t believe the whole ordeal!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, I was so afraid of failing but thank goodness I passed! Did you fail the road portion or the knowledge portion? I would have felt so awful if I had failed since I&#039;ve been driving for a good 14 years now!]]></description>
