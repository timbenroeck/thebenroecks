		<description><![CDATA[My 20s were definitely a fun decade, but I have a feeling my 30s are going to be even better! Although, traveling with a toddler is SO MUCH HARDER! We did well until she was about 18 months and then we kind of stopped trips... hopefully we&#039;ll start up again soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an amazing list! I do wish I would have traveled more before having Holland. I&#039;ve never been to any other country besides Mexico. It sounds like you did your fair share of traveling though! Cheers to 30 my friend!
