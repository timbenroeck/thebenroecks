		<description><![CDATA[Your words mean SO much to me, Kate, especially because I know you understand what I&#039;m going through! I&#039;m still trying to process my first labor and delivery experience and to think about going through it all again is TOUGH, especially since there are no guarantees to how it will turn out. But I&#039;m choosing to be so optimistic about this and I know that all babies are different so I have faith in this little one and in myself! I truly appreciate your words of encouragement!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t even tell you how much I&#039;m rooting for you to have a successful VBAC. In a way, I fell like I am vicariously living through you and if YOU get one maybe that means that I&#039;ll get one should Adam and I ever expand our family. I know it probably sounds corny from another blogger halfway across the country that you barely know -- but you got this! I&#039;ve really admired how you&#039;ve handled yourself in motherhood, in this pregnancy,... everything. I can&#039;t think of anyone better suited to be my mini-role model in this aspect. I simply cannot wait to here all about baby! I bet he or she is going to be perfect!
