		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhhh are you an obliger?! I&#039;m a questioner so I kind of realized that I&#039;m either going to do something or I&#039;m not, but accountability  (either external or internal) doesn&#039;t really help me all that much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this book as well. I am also an abstainer and a sprinter. I loved all the classifications of people and her anecdotal stories. I enjoy how conversational her writing is. This book actually showed me how much I need public accountability, and once I told my brother-in-law that I was going to start a blog, I finally did! Great review.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha you&#039;re right, I can absolutely eat just one piece of chocolate... In fact I usually have a chocolate bar in my fridge (or a box of peanut butter cups!) and eat one just every few days when I think about it! I guess I must be an abstaining questioner :)

Good luck with bedtimes and breakfast!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You moderators... I just don&#039;t get it! I would have finished the entire box in one sitting! You should definitely read the book, I think you&#039;d be able to relate to a lot of what&#039;s written! I&#039;m fascinated by rebels... I kind of want to be one, just to be different! I think it&#039;s the least common tendency out of the four Rubin lists.]]></description>
