		<description><![CDATA[I agree! I basically needed to get rid of all of my &#039;Chicago&#039; (dressy) clothes to make space in my closet for the casual and outdoorsy clothes here! It&#039;s definitely way more casual. And I agree that Seattle is nowhere near as cosmopolitan as Chicago, but I think the abundance of outdoors activities more than makes up for it - especially in the summer! I wish I had lived here without kids for a bit so I could really have explored! I hope you&#039;re enjoying it here so far! We continue to love it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fun blog post! I just moved to Seattle from Chicago four months ago. I miss Chicago&#039;s cosmopolitain essence. Seattle just doesn&#039;t seem like a &quot;big city&quot; to me. But it has the outdoors beat. You can drive an hour and hike with gorgeous views and a great workout. I&#039;m still learning about the difference between people, but the folks in Chicago tend to dress nicer than the folks in Seattle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh definitely visit Seattle if you ever have the chance, you will love it! And I agree, it&#039;s much more necessary to go to a gym in the Midwest - in Seattle I can workout outside every day of the year (even though I might get a bit wet).]]></description>
