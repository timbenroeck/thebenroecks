		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you were able to relate, Emily! And I hear ya, there are so many times during the day when I just want 5 minutes to do things for myself, even if it&#039;s just answer a text message! I really appreciate your kind words, it&#039;s so easy to be hard on ourselves as moms and encouragement is always so welcome :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I sooo needed this today--this is exactly how I feel about my son. I love him and the bond I have with him, but I struggle everyday with wanting to be selfish and just do what I want for a minute (eat a *hot* dinner instead of a cold one after helping him, spending time in the morning with devotion instead of laundry and housework I can&#039;t do at night).  I have never been able to put into words my feelings, but you did!  Thanks for being a constant support!!  You are a great mommy and Baby Beni will be lucky to have you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I often wonder if I felt especially disconnected to Clara because she was a c-section baby who had to go straight to the NICU, so I didn&#039;t actually see her until hours after she was born, and that led me to have feelings of &#039;Oh, this is my baby? Weird.&#039; It was a complete disconnect for a while! I&#039;m not sure how common it is, but other moms have told me they feel similarly so I think it&#039;s more &#039;normal&#039; than I felt it was at the time - I just don&#039;t think moms like to admit it isn&#039;t always love-at-first-sight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much, Natasha! I love those days where I&#039;m like &#039;gosh, I am AMAZING at being a mom!&#039; but then other days I think &#039;I really may not survive this...&#039; It&#039;s such a roller coaster!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it crazy to THINK you&#039;re going to feel this immense love and then it be kind of &quot;oh, this is my baby? weird.&quot; I&#039;m embarrassed to admit that post-surgery (c-section, that is) I asked for a strawberry smoothie and a coke before I asked when I could see Clara. I blame the drugs, because then I feel less guilty.]]></description>
