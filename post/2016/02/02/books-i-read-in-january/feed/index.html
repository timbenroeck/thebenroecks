		<description><![CDATA[I have read several of the same books recently! LOVED Orphan Train and Eight Hundred Grapes was a good, easy read, but I was the same way. I wanted to yell at the main characters!! Haha. I&#039;m ready Kate Morton&#039;s new book, The Lake House. So good! I love, love, love all her books! Are you on GoodReads? I love finding new friends to follow on there! Found you from Helene&#039;s FB page and wanted to say hi. New follower! XO]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You read so many amazing books this month, and way to stay on track for your book goal! I&#039;ve heard so many wonderful things about Orphan Train, The Royal We, and The Good Girl, and it really seals the deal for me that I need to read them soon because you loved them so much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you about Good Girl, the end made me like the book so much more! Bringing Up Bebe was &#039;meh&#039; for me overall, but some chapters are interesting. Adding &#039;The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy&#039; to my library list right now. :-)]]></description>
