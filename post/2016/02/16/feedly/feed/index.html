		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I haven&#039;t used the app yet! I hated the Bloglovin&#039; app and didn&#039;t even think to check for the Feedly app. Usually I read blogs on my computer so I can comment more easily. I agree, I didn&#039;t love Bloglovin&#039; (ironic) from the start, but it seemed like everyone was jumping on it so I stayed around. I&#039;m happy I made the switch over, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recommend you at least try Feedly or another reader like that! I don&#039;t know why Bloglovin&#039; seems so glitchy, but it does. Let me know if you like it :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your post has convinced me to (at least) try to make the switch! I have experienced the same thing with Bloglovin&#039; not marking read posts and it drives me totally crazy. Feedly seems a lot like Google Reader in some ways! I do like how I could comment right from Bloglovin and with Feedly you have to click through to the actual blog, which I might not always be inclined to do. I&#039;m looking forward to doing some organizing and minimalizing though! Thanks for the great overview.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t use either! Bloglovin was never my cup of tea (I&#039;m with you, when I click a link I want to go to the actual SITE, not another bloglovin page). I just do it the old fashioned way of typing the url into the browser and go from there. Also read a lot of posts (like this one) via facebook!]]></description>
