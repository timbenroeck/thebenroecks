		<description><![CDATA[Ohmygoodness, you&#039;re just one day ahead of me! We&#039;ll have to see who goes into labor first... I bet you&#039;ll &quot;win&quot; if Baby Beni is anything like his/her sister ;-) And I will say that pregnancy (for me) has been harder the second time around... so I&#039;ll let you know if it&#039;s worth it in the end - hahaha! I never had pelvis pain with the first one but am feeling a little heavier down there this time around, so I&#039;m hoping that means this baby is lower, which would be a good thing! Do you have an IG handle that I can follow so I can see any cute bump/baby pics?! I love following moms who are due around the same time as me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, we have just about the same due date - I&#039;m due April 17...well, of course, whenever he feels like it more like. But oh man, do I relate to all of this. I am so sore. My whole pelvis hurts...I don&#039;t even know what or why, but somewhere in there hurts. And rib pain. Ugh. I am so. done. And so far to go...this is my first, and he&#039;ll be lucky if he gets siblings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I want it to all be over yet... I&#039;m fairly certain I&#039;m still more comfortable now than I will be once I&#039;m sleep deprived and breastfeeding a newborn with a toddler crawling all over me! In about 8 weeks, though, I&#039;ll probably be ready for the baby to come OUT.  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you and I both have crop-top type issues with our bellies when we&#039;re so short (well, me more than you...)?! Maybe it&#039;s because our bellies go further out than tall people?!

I&#039;m now going to look up foods that block absorption... I knew Vitamin C helps absorption so was eating oranges with the iron, but I still don&#039;t feel great most days, especially at night. Now I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s a heartburn / acid reflux problem, because I have both of those lovely symptoms, too. Thankfully, no digestion problems (wait, are heartburn and acid reflux digestion problems?!) - so that&#039;s one less thing to worry about!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[35 weeks - almost there! Of course I say that to everyone over 30 weeks pregnant, and I know it could still be a while! But ohmygosh that story sounds horrible! Maybe I should take my rings off soon - YIKES. Will they be able to fix your ring?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uncomfortable I can deal with... I&#039;m not in pain and I&#039;m praising God for that! And I agree, the driver was a bit crazy to stop for me, but since it was a mostly empty intersection it was pretty drama-free  :-)  I appreciate the (what I&#039;m assuming was) chivalry, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I feel ya!!! This is definitely nature&#039;s way of prepping me to be excited about labor &#038; delivery / life with a newborn! I&#039;m not quite there yet, but I know it&#039;s only going to get more uncomfortable every day!]]></description>
