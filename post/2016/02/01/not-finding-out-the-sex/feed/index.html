		<description><![CDATA[Triplets?! WOW. If I was expecting three I think I might need to know ahead of time, too - a person can only handle so much excitement and I can&#039;t even think about needing to think of three names we agree on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We found out early b/c we were having triplets. There are SO MANY ultrasounds that go along with a multiples birth, we decided we should find out so someone doesn&#039;t accidentally &quot;slip&quot; during a scan. It was also helpful b/c we were having trouble coming up with male names we liked. Worked out all for the best... we had triplet girls! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve mentioned multiple times that this baby is most definitely a boy.... but that&#039;s based on my own intuition and nothing medical - so it has a 50% chance of being correct - hahaha! And I don&#039;t blame you at all, I definitely understand why people love finding out a baby&#039;s gender before (s)he is born! No matter what, it&#039;s such a fun surprise!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It IS the best surprise ever! I mean, it would probably be the best surprise ever no matter when you found out, but seeing the baby for the first time AND finding out the gender... the suspense makes it so sweet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#1.  I totally think it&#039;s a boy.  I actually thought you had announced that it was a boy before this point.  ;-)

#2.  I think it&#039;s so cool that you&#039;re doing this but I wouldn&#039;t want to one bit.  I loved knowing Caleb&#039;s gender and being able to call him by name from 20 weeks on!  We&#039;re planning on finding out in future pregnancies too.  :-)]]></description>
