		<description><![CDATA[You do sound like you&#039;ve been very busy! That&#039;s awesome that you are volunteering and are now an Air BnB host, it&#039;s making me feel stressed just thinking about adding all that to a busy mom schedule. Can&#039;t wait to hear more about how you manage the hosting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally approve of your favorites... except I&#039;m just not sure about Becca. I can&#039;t read her! People really are appreciative of people doing their taxes... it&#039;s so intimidating if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay I&#039;m obsessed with the Bachelor! Haha guilty. So far I love Lauren H., Lauren B, Amanda and Becca. I think that&#039;s so cool you volunteer to do people&#039;s taxes. That&#039;s a neat opportunity and I bet people appreciate it so much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh I do watch The Bachelor! Fun fact: I worked in Warsaw, IN for a few months before I met Tim, and I really feel like me and Ben should have probably met and ended up together... but alas, I missed my chance ;-) I haven&#039;t read any spoilers either and I don&#039;t want to! I like Lauren B, though!]]></description>
