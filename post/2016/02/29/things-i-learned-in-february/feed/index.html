		<description><![CDATA[Good for you on memorizing the books of the Bible. My kids did Bible Drill and learned them that way.  Yes, it&#039;s good to have a professional take photos but we never do it. I just have to make do with what I get myself. ;)  Happy rest of your pregnancy!]]></description>
