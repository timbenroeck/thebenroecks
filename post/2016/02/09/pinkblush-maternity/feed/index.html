		<description><![CDATA[Love this! It&#039;s been crazy to experience the differences with the second pregnancy {I&#039;m 28 weeks right now} vs the first! And I love pink blush - nearly every maternity piece I&#039;ve purchased this time around is from there. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t decide if I would have hated going full term with Bensen or if I would have been so happy since I was wishing for it. I got fairly uncomfortable that last week (in comparison to my entire pregnancy), but I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because I was very pregnant or if it&#039;s because I was going to deliver at any moment. 37 1/2 weeks.... I&#039;m going to be sure to plan for an early baby next time, and that will probably doom me to having my baby go full term ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Val! I totally agree that PinkBlush has some SUPER cute stuff that I would never be able to find at other stores. PLUS this coat was only priced at like $68, and I totally think I could wear it whether I&#039;m pregnant or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been rough but also so sweet at the same time! I really do love being pregnant in the second and third trimesters, but we&#039;ll see how these last few months treat me! It&#039;s definitely a whole different ballgame with a toddler in the mix!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES the second one is so sweet but in such a different way than the first - although I&#039;m sure other moms feel differently!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW. And they&#039;re having a 50% off their clearance right now, so make sure you check them out! I was tempted to buy quite a few more things...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, let&#039;s be honest, it&#039;s probably going to be 12 weeks. So far I don&#039;t actually mind that thought, but we&#039;ll see how I&#039;m doing at week 38!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That coat looks so darling on you!  I LOVE Pink Blush-- their maternity clothes are so stylish (and unique versus the standard maternity stores/options like Target where everyone shops)!  And their non-maternity is equally awesome. $75 could pick up some really cute stuff for before, during and after the bump :-) Thanks for a great giveaway!]]></description>
