		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, The Other Boleyn Girl is the best. I&#039;ve read The Constant Princess, The Queen&#039;s Fool, and a few others. The newest one (Three Sisters, Three Queens -I think) sounds pretty good to me. I&#039;m about to start The Lady of the Rivers but I don&#039;t have high hopes.... ha.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! I love my husband but he is really worthless to me when he&#039;s sick. In his defense, he gets chronic migraines so when he&#039;s sick he&#039;s REALLY out of it, but still! Also, what other Philippa Gregory books do I need to read?! I read the first book of the series (&#039;The Constant Princess&#039;, I think?) and wasn&#039;t impressed. I won&#039;t watch the movie. You&#039;ve convinced me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry your weekend was so snotty (as opposed to crappy...)!!! But I&#039;m glad that you were able to take care of yourself a little more than normal. Hopefully that will help you mend quicker!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I can so relate! I always feel guilty for not being super mom/wife when everyone is sick (including myself). My mother-in-law is so good about taking care of everyone in her family even when she doesn&#039;t feel good. I want to be her, lol! I&#039;m a work in progress. Most of the time I just want to lay in bed and have someone take care of me! Husbands have it so good! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh giiiiiiiiirl! We are connecting on SO many levels! First of all, I don&#039;t have kids, but when the husband is sick it&#039;s like the world has stopped and he needs me to be his wife/mom/nurse/roommate/chef/maid ALL DAY LONG. I can&#039;t imagine what that&#039;ll be like when there are kids in the mix. Woof...
Second, Philippa Gregory is one of my favorites. The Other Boleyn Girl is one of my favorites and I&#039;m obsessed with all the books surrounding that era and that author. I&#039;m glad you enjoyed them! (DON&#039;T WATCH THE MOVIE. It&#039;s awful.)]]></description>
