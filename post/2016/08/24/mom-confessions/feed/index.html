		<description><![CDATA[Hahahaha any lies in particular that stand out?! Sounds like a great blog post :-)  I love your reasoning, maybe instead of asking me what I was thinking (when she&#039;s older and sees pics of herself as a disheveled baby) she&#039;ll be like &#039;wow mom, thanks for letting me be such a carefree spirit!&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why can&#039;t they just be LESS fussy?!  I mean, what does she WANT?! And I think you&#039;re right... and it&#039;s hard to put coworkers in timeout when they actually AREN&#039;T toddlers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whenever my friends say they want kids close together I really try my hardest not to say NO YOU DO NOT! But I&#039;m sure I may feel differently in a few months/years! I&#039;m glad it&#039;s gotten easier for you, because that gives me hope! Also, slow walks... the worst. Especially when coffee is at the other end of the hike!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I cannot wait until they can do baths together! That sounds so much easier. Actually, I can&#039;t wait until they can do just about anything together... I&#039;m also looking forward to the 4 &#038; 2 stage! Only 2 more years ;-)]]></description>
