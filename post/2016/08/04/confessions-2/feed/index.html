		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree - gender neutral baby clothes are harder to find than they should be! I honestly think that most little boy clothes would look fine on a girl, though. Well, the ones that don&#039;t have too many patterns on them, that is. We didn&#039;t buy too many clothes for either of my girls before they were born (and then we obvi knew the gender) but we do have a bunch of yellow and green blankets, swaddles, burp cloths, etc. etc!  It&#039;s definitely my own fault for not finding out the gender ahead of time ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I should say I actually DID watch the last episode, but I watched it in fast forward mode so I could skip the awkward convos and get ride to the end. So basically I saw Jordan won and that was it. But really, she made both guys ask her parents for permission?! I mean, I guess I kind of get it, but that&#039;s so STRANGE since one of them didn&#039;t end up proposing! Wait, did they both propose or did she break up with Robby ahead of time? I hate that whole thing - it&#039;s too awkward for me to handle! There is NO WAY she stays with Jordan. It&#039;s a disaster.
Also, you need to watch Paradise. Immediately. You are only one episode behind at this point so get on it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sad to hear you never got better at Zumba! I was really hoping I would just magically be so much more coordinated the next time I go. Also, my kids may also never have themes at this rate! I can&#039;t even decide on colors I like much less a whole theme...]]></description>
