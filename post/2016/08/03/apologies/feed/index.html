		<description><![CDATA[Motherhood is indeed hard. I have a 15 month old and tantrums run me ragged. My husband had the baby alone last week and he told me the tantrums make him want to throw our son in the garbage. We have to extend grace to our sweet babies and ourselves. One day at a time! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AMEN TO THAT! I also used to think mornings were so quick and then I had babies and now I&#039;m like REALLY? IT ISN&#039;T EVEN 10am?! I can only imagine the chaos that is going to happen when Isabelle starts crawling... I&#039;m getting a headache just thinking about it! And I totally agree, toddlers are forgiving and that&#039;s why it&#039;s so great to practice apologizing with them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess God just forgot to add that in with all of the other amazing qualities he gave us! That&#039;s what I tell myself, anyways. Clara and I had a REALLY bad day yesterday and I told her, &quot;sweetheart, this is why mommies shake their babies.&quot; and then I felt bad. I just CANNOT handle the overtired MELTDOWNS that last for HOURS. I mean, I didn&#039;t even know that was possible, but it happened! Still a work in progress over here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are way, way too nice to me! I used to think handling just one kid was hard but now when I go out with just Clara I think to myself &#039;THIS IS SO EASY! I am capable! I didn&#039;t even have to pack a diaper bag!&#039; and when I go out with just Isabelle I think &#039;she&#039;s sleeping! I can carry her in a carseat! I can wear her and she can&#039;t run away! This is the best!&#039; so you will get there, too, I&#039;m certain! Today both kids started WAILING at the same time in their stroller and I started cracking up and I&#039;m pretty sure all of the people passing by thought I had lost my mind. But it was just so funny because it was so awful and loud and for no apparent reason. Also, I&#039;m still working on apologizing to adults more... It&#039;s easier with toddlers! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YOU ARE SO RIGHT! We recently got a play kitchen for Clara&#039;s 2nd bday (grandma gift!) and it is so nice to be able to ask for a cup of coffee or slice of pizza while I&#039;m nursing Isabelle. Clara takes food prep VERY seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think many people DO have the patience! It is really all-consuming sometimes. I get kind of annoyed when moms/parents write about how &#039;worth it&#039; the hard times are. I mean, who are they trying to convince?! Some days I don&#039;t believe it is worth it in that moment and I think that&#039;s totally fine! I didn&#039;t choose to be a mother because the good moments would make the bad moments &#039;worth it&#039;, I became a mother because I think it&#039;s important work and I felt called to do so. (Sorry, mini-rant!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yikes.  I&#039;m certain I don&#039;t have the patience for it!  I love it how at the end of the post you didn&#039;t feel the need to say how &quot;worth it&quot; all of it is.  It&#039;s one of the few mommy venting posts I see that don&#039;t.  Go ahead and vent! You are justified, and of course it doesn&#039;t mean you wish you never had your children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha oh man I think this is why play kitchens were invented!! Then Clara can &quot;help&quot; by making you some &quot;tea&quot; (air) and a &quot;sandwich&quot; (pile of hard plastic)... That&#039;s how my fam did it, at least! Kids making &quot;tea&quot; is the best because they basically get out a toy cup, pretend to fill it with water and then have to keep checking whether or not it&#039;s &quot;ready&quot;... Provides several solid minutes of occupied distraction!!]]></description>
