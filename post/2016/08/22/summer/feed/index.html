		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you guys have been able to get outside so much! I know that was one of your big hopes with moving to Seattle -- no more being cooped up inside because of extreme cold or extreme heat. I&#039;m so glad that&#039;s exactly how it&#039;s worked out!!]]></description>
