		<description><![CDATA[YES we did so many things with Clara, especially when she was little, but traveling with a toddler and a baby is a whole different (difficult) ball game! I&#039;m most concerned about time zone changes at this point, to be honest! I think I definitely need to plan an outdoorsy vacation ASAP because Clara would love to spend her days running around outside!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is DEFINITELY possible to keep up with an active lifestyle, but it&#039;s just really difficult! I think if you have low expectations, it helps, but also a lot of motivation to get out and do fun things! I love the PNW... we just moved here in October and I&#039;m so freakin&#039; impressed with life here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this post. FTM and I have started to get a bit anxious about the idea of not being as active as I am now. I am also a PNW native and I love doing all the Seattle things - I know that my life is going to change, but I am happy to hear that it is possible to still do the things I love even if doing those things might not be as easy as they were when it was just me, the hubs, and the dogs]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found it really not very difficult to travel with one kid. I don&#039;t at all know how it would be with two, but we&#039;ve taken R on 9 plane flights and a 13-hr road trip and yes, it&#039;s been harder than if we didn&#039;t have her, and it&#039;s been way more stressful, but we have had a great time and already made some memories! So yes, definitely better to go than to stay, in my opinion (most of the time, anyway.) So glad you enjoyed your time with your friends! Boo about the ticket, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes yes yes! I&#039;m learning this too. It&#039;s easier to stay at home in my sweats, but I rarely regret saying yes to getting out of the house!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am totally with you on this!! We do day trips all the time! I would say maybe 1-2 times a month! Our kids are 4 and almost 3, and we have another girl on the way in October. With three, I&#039;ll be nervous. But, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find our groove. Honestly, staying home is what drives me bonkers haha. I&#039;m not that great at entertaining at home and would much rather be on the go! Glad you guys had a great time in Portland!!!
