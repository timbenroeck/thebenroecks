		<description><![CDATA[Well, I don&#039;t have kids so I just going to give you advice based on what my 16-17 year old self did: which was multiple children and usually youngsters! I babysat for families who had multiple kids. Some babies, some tossed, some elementary. I can&#039;t remember ever having problems.  I remember feeling stressed if sometimes it was difficult because I didn&#039;t want the parent to think i I couldn&#039;t handle it and then never hire me again! I believe it was $10 flat rate and $2 more per kid per hour, but only if they were awake. Sleeping kids were just a flat $2 extra

		<description><![CDATA[I totally think a high schooler could handle it. When I was in high school, I used to babysit 3-4 kids at a time, with ages ranging from 4 months to 10 years old. We used to have a babysitter take care of 5 of us in my family (baby-8 years old) and she was awesome. The key is that they are focusing on the bedtime routine and only the bedtime routine, and they know they are leaving at the end, so for them, the stress of the day in/day out of doing it hasn&#039;t set in. If you don&#039;t know about your sitter, I&#039;d just ask her if she&#039;d be comfortable with it. Could be just my experience, but in my opinion, two kids ages 4 months and 2 years would be something reasonable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because she&#039;s so little and was born right before cold/flu/RSV season, we have to keep her in as much as possible and away from other people and places where she might catch things. Basically, bubble baby... which also means we have a somewhat bubble Bensen to keep him away from exposure to things he could catch and bring home to her and we have to be careful as well. She gets my immunities so I&#039;ve had my tdap and flu shot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! Nursing friendly (and cute) dresses are so freakin&#039; hard to find and I&#039;m tired of not wearing my full wardrobe! And it was amazing to eat GOOD food instead of take-out. Ahhhh I&#039;m happy just thinking about it! I hope you&#039;re able to go on a date night soon - it&#039;s so hard with family being far away!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do it while you only have one! Except I didn&#039;t want to go on dates at all at the end of my (even though we had family in town at the time) because just felt so lousy. Wah wah. Do you think a high schooler could handle both of my girls (their ages, that is)? I really like our babysitter but I don&#039;t want to overwhelm her because I want her to keep coming back! Haha!]]></description>
