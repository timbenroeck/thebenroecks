		<description><![CDATA[I feel like R is right in the middle of those. She definitely has her fussy moments, and when she&#039;s teething she is a MESS. But she is also a really happy baby and we cart her around a lot. Hopefully when we have another baby she or he is just as good! Cute pictures of you all :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that was my greatest fear with Emmy, that she was going to be awake all day long and fussy because she was ALWAYS moving. Now that she&#039;s on the outside, I know that she&#039;s just legitimately always moving, even in her sleep. That girl is so squirmy!! But, there is a chance that all could change, and it&#039;s my greatest fear that she&#039;ll become difficult because I&#039;m used to Bensen who was &quot;easy&quot; relatively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dude. if I had known more about Clara&#039;s temperament when I was dealing with Amelia, I may have had to stop reading your blog. because Amelia is my Isabelle. I know that she came to me first because I needed a serious crash course in patience and character building, but I&#039;m really hoping #2 will be my napper and easy one. although I guess if this one is the same as her at least i&#039;ll know what to expect?]]></description>

Shit got real.  Hang in there, please keep blogging so I know I&#039;m not alone on this crazy journey!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so interesting and crazy to me how different my two kids are. They were both on the &quot;easier&quot; side as newborns but since then pretty much everything is different. Shy vs Outgoing. Loves food vs Picky Eater. Late talker vs Early babbling. I could go on and on!]]></description>
