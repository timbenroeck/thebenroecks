		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW! It&#039;s totally upsetting to me that women don&#039;t get more time off, but I&#039;m thrilled with the 12 weeks that Tim is getting! I hope more employers start moving in that direction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even two weeks isn&#039;t enough time! A week... it&#039;s just ridiculous that employers don&#039;t offer their employees more time with the addition of a whole new family member! Tim got four weeks off for Clara and I&#039;m just SO EXCITED about these 12 weeks! (He took two of them right after Isabelle was born and has 10 left.) It&#039;s already going by too quickly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just can&#039;t believe they didn&#039;t give you more time off, especially in California which is the only state that has mandatory maternity leave for employers... right?! Couldn&#039;t that be a potential lawsuit on our part if they didn&#039;t make you aware of your rights?]]></description>
