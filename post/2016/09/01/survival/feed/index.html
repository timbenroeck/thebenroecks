		<description><![CDATA[Your life sure is chaotic right now!  I went through a few months like that back in spring, and like you said it&#039;s just a season.  Either that or I just got used to the chaos and now it seems normal!  Either way, you&#039;ll make it through and come out stronger in the end :)  I believe in you!

Thanks for taking the time to link up with us!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, I totally loved my first hike  but it was EXHAUSTING. I recommend going on a toddler-led hike and wearing the smaller baby so you don&#039;t have to push a stroller. And bring a snack so that if all of the other kids have one your kid doesn&#039;t stare at them longingly until they share... because yeah, that definitely happened to us! Hahahaha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! I don&#039;t want to give up anything but when it rains, it pours! Everything I&#039;m involved in seems to be getting more hectic in this season, but it should get slower after October. Hopefully!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gosh the balance between doing too much and being bored is SO hard to find! It totally varies day to day for me! I think motherhood has the tendency to be very boring and isolating for me, so I definitely go out of my way to be active in other things, too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The exhaustion is REAL in the third tri! I&#039;m so glad I have most of my energy back AT LAST. Once I stop breastfeeding I probably won&#039;t  even recognize myself, I&#039;ll feel so good! I can&#039;t believe he doesn&#039;t get any paternity leave! That is AWFUL and shouldn&#039;t even be legal. It seems like almost no companies offer it and I hate that. Tim went back to work after 2 weeks and it wasn&#039;t so bad, so hopefully you get into the groove of things pretty quickly! And either way, definitely snapchat away :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awww thanks for the kind words! I really love MOPS. We didn&#039;t have it in Chicago and I have no clue why, it&#039;s such a great organization and I highly recommend it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words! One baby is plenty overwhelming, so your feelings are VERY valid! I just want someone to be at my house 100% of the time who cooks and cleans and sometimes babysits... for free. Is that really too much to ask?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It IS super overwhelming, but I also know this is just a season where everything is happening at once and it should all slow down in a few months! When it rains it pours right?! And I love what you say about different moms - so true!]]></description>
