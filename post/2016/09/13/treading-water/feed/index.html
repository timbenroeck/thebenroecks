		<description><![CDATA[So far paternity HAS made life so much better - and I finally have time to respond to comments... two weeks late... whoops! I do think I&#039;ll end up going back to work in a few years and if not I&#039;m still going to put Clara in some sort of program so I can have a few hours of just Isabelle time. Or I may hire a part time nanny so I can have TRUE free time! My sanity is totally gone at this point and I think it would really help me to have someone watch the girls for a  bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a lot of women go through this... props to you for actually SAYING it! It&#039;s natural, it&#039;s normal. Like you said, just gotta keep swimming. You&#039;re a great mom. You&#039;ve got this. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used the exact wording of &quot;treading water&quot; to Chris the other day! No words of advice (obviously-ha) but I&#039;m so glad he&#039;s going to get to take some paternity leave! I hope that&#039;s able to refresh you in some way, even if only for a little bit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YAY for paternity leave!!! I&#039;m sure that will make everything a million times better!!! :)

I went back to work (FT job but I work from home a lot, so my girls are in daycare PT!) when my oldest was 3 and my youngest was 1 1/2. It. was. time. But seriously, I was ready. In a few months or a year or so you could always end up doing the same thing!! But, even if you don&#039;t, I highly recommend a little daycare/school/Mother&#039;s Morning Out program for Clara!! Even if I quit my job, my kiddos would still be attending their &quot;school&quot; LOL. Alone time is completely necessary for my sanity!

Anyways, hang in there mama!! You are doing a fantastic job and your girls are so, so lucky to have you as their mom!!
