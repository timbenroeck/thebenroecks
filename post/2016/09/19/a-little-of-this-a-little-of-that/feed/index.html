		<description><![CDATA[Congrats on your new family member! Haha. I had a bunch of fish when I was a kid, and they were pretty hit or miss. Some of them died within two weeks, others lived for 10 years (no lie. That fish wish was mentally distressed, though. He tried to commit suicide twice, and failed both times. He eventually died of natural causes.). That&#039;s hilarious about the weather - my aunt (who lives on the Eastside) ALWAYS complains about the greyness of Seattle, even though she&#039;s lived there for most of her life, so I figured everyone hated it. Apparently not so!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I swear, it&#039;s the change of the seasons (barometric pressure weirdness?) that makes this time of year so hard. I think it affects little ones a lot more intensely than most of us feel it, and it causes that stress for us parents too. (p.s. I would have &quot;forgotten&quot; our fish at the party...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve got some ladies going through the same life phase as you. It&#039;s nice to be able to lean on others a bit!
How odd to give three-year-olds a fish..... That&#039;s kind of cruel to the fish and the parents! Ha!]]></description>
