		<description><![CDATA[I just cannot wrap my mind around how Trump can blatantly lie, over and over and over again--and not even kind of lie, or stretch the truth, or leave out critical information, but straight up lie, lie like me saying I&#039;m actually a golden retriever and not a human--and get away with it, both getting away with it in the sense that there seem to be absolutely ZERO consequences for intentionally and willfully misleading people (shouldn&#039;t something like that be illegal?! ISN&#039;T stuff like that illegal?! Apple can&#039;t say that buying an iPhone will guarantee that you&#039;ll never get cancer, because that&#039;s blatant, outright false advertising. How on EARTH is that illegal, when Trump&#039;s equally blatant, outright false statements aren&#039;t? And for that matter, how is him portraying himself as a viable leader of this country not false advertising? That seems like a bigger lie than if Apple were to tell me my phone would make me cancer-proof.), and getting away with it in the sense that people, lots and lots of people, believe him! Is the plight of the disenfranchised working class white male really so terrible that they will truly believe anything they want to hear, anything that makes false promises about returning to a time that will never, ever come back? I can&#039;t fathom that kind of desperation--desperation that makes logic and truth irrelevant and blinds you to reality. It all just boggles my mind.]]></description>
