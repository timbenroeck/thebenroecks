		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I will not feel guilty for resting&quot; I feel you! Of course, I don&#039;t have pregnancy and chasing a toddler as an excuse like you do. Well, excuse isn&#039;t the right word. I don&#039;t have these wonderful things to need rest from. lol Also Yay for Clara for potty training!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh you know that you&#039;re on my very, very short list of people to talk to about this stuff! I have my 36 week OB appointment tomorrow and my doula appointment on Thursday, so expect me to be reaching out this week! And totally buy the small potty. They&#039;re like $10 and we have two of them. We just left it by our toilets so she could sit on hers while we were going to the bathroom, and she loved it! She wouldn&#039;t use it every day, but she got the general idea. I think not pushing it was key for us because she got interested without the pressure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aw, thanks so much for the encouragement! I went to Prague for my babymoon with Clara and LOVED it! What an awesome city. I&#039;m working on the shamelessly relaxing but this toddler o&#039; mine seems to have other ideas about what I should be doing with my time!  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW! How did she get so old!? Although right now she&#039;s having a mini-tantrum on the floor and I&#039;m not sure if this makes her older or younger in my mind but it&#039;s definitely making me less sentimental. Hahaha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know, it feels so close yet so far away! Clara is going to be SO excited. The amount of attention she already pays to the baby belly is crazy and I&#039;m going to have my hands full making sure she doesn&#039;t over-love the baby once (s)he doesn&#039;t have my uterus for protection!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[anytime you want to vent or chat about labor and birth stuff, you know I&#039;m here for you lady. you will be amazing, no matter what happens. and also, yes to having a potty trained child!!! every time Amelia tells me she is peeing or pooping, I ask her if she wants to go on the potty, and she says no, so we are not quite there yet haha. I&#039;m thinking I might invest in her own potty and see if that jumpstarts her interest since it&#039;ll be her size.]]></description>
