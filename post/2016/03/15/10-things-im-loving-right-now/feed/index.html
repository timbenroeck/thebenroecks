		<description><![CDATA[Hi Viktorija! I&#039;ve heard all about you from Giedre (all good things, of course)! I can&#039;t believe neither you nor Giedre found out the gender of the babies - such fun! Do you have a feeling if it&#039;s a boy or a girl?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh definitely check it out because Tim is OBSESSED and keeps telling everyone in the world they need to own one. I  haven&#039;t used it yet because I&#039;m always afraid I&#039;ll injure myself with gadgets. Also, YAY for not finding out the gender (in the future)! People always are amazed that we don&#039;t know whether Baby Beni is a boy or a girl but I just love not knowing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness that pineapple cutter looks like a kitchen gadget I may actually use! I keep telling my friends/family that I don&#039;t want to find out the gender of my (future) children and people literally can&#039;t believe it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that you don&#039;t know the gender of baby Beni! I&#039;m 32 weeks 4 days and don&#039;t know either. Almost every mom I tell that to looks at me with this bewildered expression and tells me she could never do that. I love surprises--and I love not knowing! Also, I&#039;ve been reading your blog for a few months and really enjoy it! Giedre is my sis--she&#039;s the one who introduced me to your blog. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WHHAAAT?! How were you NOT a JoJo fan?! I can&#039;t believe he said &#039;I love you&#039; to two women. That&#039;s a horrible idea. That&#039;s worse than sleeping with two women at the same time - which is still not ideal but better than leading them both on to such a crazy extent! I kind of wonder what Caila was thinking when the producers told her she wasn&#039;t going to be the Bachelorette anymore... I feel kind of bad for her! And I&#039;ve had the WORST luck with TJ flowers! I don&#039;t know what it is about them, but they always last for like a day. My Whole Foods flowers haven&#039;t fared much better though, so I&#039;m quite sure it&#039;s probably just me.]]></description>
