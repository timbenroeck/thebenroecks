		<description><![CDATA[A few things. I made my husband get down all of the baby gear last week while we were on Spring Break so I could start washing it. I was afraid the next chance we would have would be too late! I still need to pack hospital bags and diaper bags (in case C2 is anything like her sister and doesn&#039;t follow the plan), but for the most part we&#039;re ready to go. I really did schedule a blow out, though. Haha! ;) I&#039;m contemplating some type of overnight staycation in Indianapolis (about an hour from our house) just to have one last date night with the hubs before we&#039;re the parents of TWO.

Come on, Baby Beni! Hopefully a relaxing hair appointment sends you straight into labor. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you been crossing a lot of things off?! I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s already been 2 weeks since I wrote this list but I still definitely have items left to do! I love how you&#039;re getting a blow-out... haha! You&#039;re going to look so good in those pics! I have my hair appointment on Wednesday so hopefully Baby Beni takes that as his/her cue to come on out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it weird that I feel comforted knowing my to-do list before C2 looks similar? Haha! Scheduling a blow out and pedicure before my c-section is pretty much priority No. 1!]]></description>
