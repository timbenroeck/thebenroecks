		<description><![CDATA[It depends where you live and how big your house is, but for us it would be around $100ish every other week and more if they only come once per month (because then there&#039;s more for them to do).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking the same! I can keep up with the every day cleaning/picking up, but the stuff that takes a lot of time just gets put on the back burner and never gets done. Any idea how much this costs?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, motherhood will be BEYOND worth it. I feel like &#039;worth it&#039; means that the positives will kind of outweigh the negatives, but in my experience, while it&#039;s important to be prepared for the exhaustion and mental fatigue and the unglamorous and freakin&#039; HARD parts of motherhood, the wonderful moments you are about to experience will surpass anything you could ever imagine and will quite simply blow your mind. I&#039;m so excited for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both of my babies were surprises too, and I always say I&#039;m so thankful because if I had waited until I was &#039;ready&#039;, I probably would have never had Clara! God knows what I need more than I do! Trust me, you will sleep, you will go out, your birth story will eventually be ancient history that you will share with other people... and without a DOUBT your heart will be bigger than you ever thought it could be! I mean &#039;worth it&#039; doesn&#039;t even begin to describe my experience with motherhood. It has been completely hard and transformative but also the BIGGEST blessing I could have ever imagined. I think the hard parts of motherhood are worth mentally preparing yourself for, only because the positives you will simply experience and be overwhelmed by in the best of ways.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this post! I&#039;m due in 2 weeks with my first, and while people have given me plenty of &quot;advice&quot; during my pregnancy, I haven&#039;t heard anything as honest and real as this. I know it will be worth it no matter what though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh, I almost feel the opposite - I swear everything anyone has ever said to me about having kids has been more negative than good!  If this baby hadn&#039;t been a nice little surprise ;), I really don&#039;t know how long it would have taken us to have kids for this exact reason.  All I hear are horror stories about never sleeping again, no social life, terrifying birth stories haha.  I know it will be okay though and we&#039;ll get through it because everyone does and then we&#039;ll say it was totally worth it :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re in the thick of it, for sure! It&#039;s awesome that you felt so prepared, but I agree, recovery is HARD. At least for me, the recovery from a c-section was the WORST and I was totally unprepared for bathroom experiences after that. I figured since I didn&#039;t have a vaginal delivery that everything would be the same &#039;down there&#039;. NOPE. That&#039;s what I&#039;m most afraid of for having a toddler and a newborn... how will I function during recovery?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with you Kate, I&#039;m not sure I would have understood either, even if someone told me! Maybe people did tell me and my then-pregnant self just didn&#039;t listen. It&#039;s a totally different ballgame once you&#039;re in the &#039;mom club&#039; and have other moms to share experiences with, because then everyone kind of &#039;gets it&#039;. Yep, parenthood is awesome and weird and I feel really, really blessed to be Clara&#039;s mom, even if my life has completely changed!]]></description>
