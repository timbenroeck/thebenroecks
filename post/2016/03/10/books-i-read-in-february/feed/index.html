		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t give up on Young Adult Fiction. Miss Peregrine&#039;s Home for Peculiar Children is a really bad example. I read a ton of YA, and I really disliked that book. Maybe try something more contemporary. I suggest something by Rainbow Rowell or Morgan Matson. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Lisa

I&#039;ve embarked on my own reading challenge this year and so far I&#039;m enjoying it :) 

One of the more recent books I&#039;ve read that I would highly recommend is The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton. A word of warning though; although I absolutely loved it i found it a bit &quot;blah&quot; and tedious about 3/4&#039;s of the way through. But that wouldn&#039;t stop me reading more of her work!
