		<description><![CDATA[one: that verse up there is one of my all time favorites. 
two: I think this is such amazing testimony on listening to God, even when you&#039;re not sure why He&#039;s saying what He&#039;s saying. ever since I &quot;met&quot; you, I&#039;ve always been in awe at your ability to listen and really hear what He&#039;s calling you to do!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Timing is so crazy - isn&#039;t it?! What company are you working for in Chicago now? (Did I already ask you that?) I believe that you&#039;re probably going to end up in Seattle eventually, but who knows when that will be?! I can&#039;t believe how quickly time has seemed to pass by in my 20s - so much has happened in the past few years - way more than I ever expected! So I guess I&#039;m encouraging you that life can and will change quickly and just be open to it and you&#039;ll end up exactly where you&#039;re supposed to be! It sounds like you&#039;re supposed to be in Chicago at this awesome job right now  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an awesome story, Lisa!! I love seeing how you guys could clearly see God&#039;s hand in what he was calling you to do- and you did it, despite the fact that staying in Chicago would be easier. So encouraged by you guys!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve felt for years and years that I&#039;m going to ultimately end up living in Seattle, and earlier this year, I really thought the time to move was going to be sooner rather than later - when I started dating my now-ex-boyfriend, I had been just about ready to move to Seattle, and then didn&#039;t, obviously, because I started dating him, but told myself if we broke up, I was going to move. Then things started going terribly at my current job, so I started applying for new work, but only in Chicago. Then it looked like my relationship was ending, and I still didn&#039;t have a new job in Chicago, so I started looking for positions in Seattle as well, because I REALLY thought that all of this happening at once was a sign it was time for me to go to Seattle. Then we broke up, and two days later I got a job offer at (what at least seems to be) a fantastic company in Chicago - so apparently it wasn&#039;t actually time for me to move quite yet! But even with how out of control I felt with all of these things, it was reassuring to know that God was going to make things work out in the best way for me, so if He thinks Chicago is where I should be right now, I&#039;m going to trust that that&#039;s right (and hopefully Seattle will be in the cards somewhere down the road :) ).]]></description>
