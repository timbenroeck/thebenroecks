		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha I&#039;m always behind on the trends, too! Snapchat is different in a lot of ways but basically it&#039;s still very instant while Instagram is very posed and filtered. I use it a lot during the day to take pics and videos of what the girls and I are doing, and then Tim checks it to see what we&#039;ve been up to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, after a few days of using it I love chatting with it just to &#039;comment&#039; on what&#039;s going on in other people&#039;s days. Is that creepy? Do people expect it? I still don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I pretty much agree with everyone else in their comments. I need to be better at using Snapchat though, I hardly ever remember to use it, but when I do I share to my story constantly! I think it is a really great way for bloggers to connect with each other in another way. Blogs and Instagrams can be totally pretty and clean, but snapchat is more for real life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really understand the posting of 10 videos in a row that are just one continuous message... isn&#039;t that really not the point? That&#039;s like writing 10 tweets in a row instead of a blog post. I&#039;m going to have to work on this video thing since I don&#039;t normally take them...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really understand snapchat, but I have it! Just figured out, for the first time, how the &quot;story&quot; thing works -- usually I just send (and mainly receive) goofy direct messages, mostly involving bizarre filters... I will send you one as an example!]]></description>
