		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhhh great idea to use a backpack instead of a purse. I read somewhere that the average purse is 8 lbs and women do so much damage to their backs by hauling them around. I can&#039;t even imagine what the weight of an average diaper bag would be with all of the baby stuff in it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You were so wise not to even register for a diaper bag! Some of the pockets would be helpful but honesty I don&#039;t mind not having them with my backpack! I&#039;m thankful there&#039;s a compartment in the front for my cell phone and lipgloss but everything else I just throw in the main area. Other people are probably way more organized than I am, though!

Also, Lily Jade bags are gorgeous and I am sad that I am not a bijillionaire.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YESSSSSSS girl YES. I didn&#039;t register for a diaper bag, because I thought the prices were outrageous, and because I thought it would be hard to anticipate diaper bag &quot;needs&quot; as a first time mom who was cloth diapering. For the first few weeks when I lugged around every baby item we own, I just used a tote bag we had, and now I just use a small black Jansport backpack or sometimes just the Skip Hop changing station if we&#039;re running in and out of a store or somewhere quickly. I do think it helps to (like you said) invest in a GOOD backpack that won&#039;t fall apart, and compartments are helpful. The one we use is duarable and great quality, but unfortunately doesn&#039;t have any pockets or compartments inside, which would help with the classic diaper bag chaos. We&#039;ll probably be upgrading soon because of it!

HOWEVER - if someone wanted to loan me a couple hundred bucks for a Lilly Jade...that would be okay. Are those not the most beautiful bags EVERR?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been carrying a diaper bag with me all through college, and now as a teacher I went back to carrying a backpack! SO convenient! Also, after an unfortunate incident where all of my purses were in a container that got moldy in the basement, I invested in a tinier kavu backpack as my permanent purse. Out of place sometimes but so worth it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A practical diaper bag is a must! Instead of spending a ton of money on a bag that was designed specifically as a diaper bag, I went to MEC (Canada&#039;s version of REI) and picked up a messenger bag. Its stylish and not girly (important for my husband) and once babe grows out of it, we can use it as her overnight bag or carryon.]]></description>
