		<description><![CDATA[I tell people to go for 2.5 years apart and get the potty training done with before Baby #2 comes along! That was one of the hardest things to do with both. I think it will be nice in a couple years though to have them so close together... Easier to do joint activities that everyone enjoys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I consider myself brave... more like clueless! It wasn&#039;t my best idea to have a baby in the midst of potty training and sleep training and molar growing and the million other transitions happening for Clara right now! 

I totally thought we would clear out a ton of stuff when we moved to Seattle, but instead we moved it all here (because we hired packers so I didn&#039;t need to go through everything at the time) and then when we were unpacking we got rid of some stuff but a lot of stuff got put away anyway... Basically I still have a ton of decluttering to do! Good luck with yours!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s SUCH a good feeling! And I think you&#039;re so right - it&#039;s been proven that clutter stresses people out and a clean space makes a big difference for some people&#039;s mental state. I am for sure one of those people!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YES! We&#039;re renting such a small space and it makes all of our stuff seem completely overwhelming. I don&#039;t know if everyone else has less than me or if they&#039;re just way better organized! Maybe I need to hire someone to come in and redo my house...]]></description>
