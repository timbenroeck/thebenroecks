		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE my Hydro Flask! I got one a year and a half or two years ago, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be able to use another water bottle ever again. It&#039;s amazing!

When I was dying/melting/generally cursing myself for not trying harder to get a job in Seattle when I was job hunting late last year/earlier this year this past weekend, I had the bright idea to check the temperature in Seattle, and saw it was 69 degrees (while our real feel was sitting at a cool 106 here in Chicago). I need to convince my company to open an office out in Seattle so I can keep my job and move out there and never, ever have to deal with another weekend like last weekend ever again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Listen...if you brag at me ONE MORE TIME about your gorgeous PNW summer weather I will cyber punch you.
Sincerely,
103 in Texas

...

OKAY KIDDING. I won&#039;t cyber bully you. Not because you don&#039;t deserve it...but because I&#039;m too tired. ;) 

SAME to so many of these things. My hydroflask is literally LIFE. My only complaint is that my ice cold water doesn&#039;t fit in my teeny tiny Corrola cupholders. Wahhhhhh first world problems am I right?]]></description>
