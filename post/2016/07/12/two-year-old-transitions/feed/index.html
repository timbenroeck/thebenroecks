		<description><![CDATA[i am feeling a LOT of the same emotions right now, as Amelia is t-minus one month from being two. we don&#039;t have the same transitions (she&#039;s not a climber, not a big sister...yet, and while she likes to sit on the potty, is not interested in going to the bathroom on it...yet), but a lot of the same tantrums and angry outbursts and BIG love too. her turning two is going to make me a mess. I have a hangry one too, I&#039;m starting to realize I have to watch for that a lot more proactively. (also: can I just ask, WHERE do they learn to yell? we don&#039;t yell at our house, so why am I always getting yelled at by a two year old?) congrats on making it to the two-year mark, you&#039;ve done an amazing job.]]></description>
