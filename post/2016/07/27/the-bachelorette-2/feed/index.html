		<description><![CDATA[The Men Tell All is kind of boring BUT you get to see a lot of Chad and a fun Bachelor in Paradise preview so I am a fan! I agree with your prediction. It will be Jordan and then they will break up, the end.
Luke HAS to be the new bachelor. I&#039;m not ready to have him off my TV for good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh get ready for Bachelor in Paradise, because that is the most excellent part of the Bachelor franchise! I haven&#039;t seen UnReal but I&#039;ll look into it! I honestly watch like 3 shows on TV right now and am so out of the loop!
And yes, I think they pretty much sleep with everyone in the fantasy suites and justify it because they&#039;ll get engaged to one of them so obvi need to try them all out. Haha! But no one really talks about it afterwards. It&#039;s so weird.
I&#039;m still mad at her about Luke. But I agree, I think she really wants to find her perfect match but somehow she has horrible taste in men! Although to be fair, I&#039;m not sure I loved this entire cast!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope Robby wins, too, because I can just not see her with Jordan and totally agree that they would end up breaking up. But I also agree that her and Robby will break up soon too if they end up together... But it would make me sad if she went through this whole process and doesn&#039;t end up finding her match but it would make sense because HER MATCH WAS LUKE. 
I wish I was more interested in the finale but now I&#039;m just NOT. Unless she doesn&#039;t pick either of them. I&#039;d be all for that.
And the Chase thing... the thing is, if she didn&#039;t know about him I&#039;m even MORE confused as to why she sent Luke home. I just 100% do not get it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love it when you post about The Bachelorette because then I can pour all my thoughts out to someone who&#039;s actually interested (other than my roommates, that is).

As I&#039;ve said several times, I have not been a particular fan of this season. I could not find it in me to have any sort of emotional investment in pretty much ANY of these guys, and I hated how they were all Variations on an Abercrombie and Fitch model, making it SO DIFFICULT to keep them straight. I didn&#039;t know who was who until like mid June, which also made it pretty challenging to actually care about any of them, when the best I could do was, &quot;Yeah, that guy with the face seems decent.&quot; That being said, if Luke isn&#039;t the next bachelor, I&#039;m going to punch a wall (metaphorically. Because doing that literally would be both painful and useless). He&#039;s the only one of the final four that I could conjure up even a little bit of sympathy for, and I did feel bad for him after Jojo let him go, because he seems so shell-shocked I don&#039;t know how you could NOT feel bad for him. Also, all Jojo&#039;s &quot;I keep worrying that I made a mistake!&quot; stuff? DUH, SWEETIE! How can you not see through Jordan&#039;s games????

I thought the Chase situation was pretty unfortunate. Now, admittedly, I&#039;ve never been in Thailand with three identical guys who have all professed their love for me in the space of a week, so maybe it IS entirely possible that she didn&#039;t know until that exact second that she wasn&#039;t interested in Chase. I wouldn&#039;t know. I&#039;ve never been in that situation. However, in all of my dating experience, I have never once had a situation where my feelings changed THAT dramatically THAT quickly about someone, so I call shenanigans. I don&#039;t like that she invited him into the fantasy suite. I mean, I don&#039;t know. Maybe she was on the fence about him, and thought spending the night with him would help her figure things out. But still, that just...does not seem like the best way to figure out whether or not you&#039;re actually interested in someone. And if you&#039;re that confused on whether or not you&#039;re interested in the first place, you&#039;re probably not interested!

I really hope Robby wins. Whether or not he&#039;s here for the &quot;right reasons&quot;...well, I don&#039;t believe anyone on that show is REALLY there with the ultimate end goal of finding a spouse. Except maybe Ben Higgins, but as far as I&#039;m concerned he can do absolutely no wrong and is perfect hahaha. But I do believe that Robby is genuinely interested in Jojo. I don&#039;t believe that about Jordan at all. I think he&#039;s playing her, based on the fact that he can&#039;t even bring himself to LIE about seeing himself married to her in a year, and quite frankly I think she&#039;s far more interested in the fact that he&#039;s Aaron Rodgers&#039;s brother than she&#039;s interested in being with Jordan. But as much as I hope Robby wins, I don&#039;t really see it happening. Jordan is such a front runner and has been all season (I really feel like this Robby thing came completely out of left field), that I can&#039;t imagine him not winning. But I also don&#039;t see them staying together. 

An alternative outcome I&#039;d be super down with: Jojo picking neither of them. THAT would be a shocking season finale, Chris Harrison.

My roommate theorizes that whoever Jojo does (or does not) pick next week, she&#039;s already broken up with them. That was the vibe she got from Men Tell All (which I didn&#039;t watch because I was busy that night, and probably won&#039;t watch because I think those episodes are boring). And that wouldn&#039;t really surprise me, to be honest, because I don&#039;t get Ben/Lauren or even Kaitlyn/Shawn vibes from Jojo/Jordan or Jojo/Robby.

Thus concludes my five-paragraph essay on the most recent episode of The Bachelorette. You&#039;re welcome. Hahaha :P]]></description>
