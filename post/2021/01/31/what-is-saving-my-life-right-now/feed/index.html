		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the wimpiness! We&#039;ve only been here for 5 years and I consider anything under 45 degrees way too cold. I don&#039;t know how I survived my first 25 winters in Chicago - ha! But I do love my outdoor walks! I&#039;m glad you have a friend to do that with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is something I say to friends all the time: “X is saving my life right now!” These says it’s in-person school for the two older kids, living close to my parents so we can walk over as an “outing”, and my new reading chair haha. It’s been inspiring me to read more often because I just want to cozy up in it every night!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Walks with my best friend around our small town are just the best 40 minutes of my day. It doesn&#039;t happen much in the winter though unless it is 30 degrees or warmer. We are both wimps when it comes to being cold!]]></description>
