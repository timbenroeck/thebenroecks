		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the wimpiness! We&#039;ve only been here for 5 years and I consider anything under 45 degrees way too cold. I don&#039;t know how I survived my first 25 winters in Chicago - ha! But I do love my outdoor walks! I&#039;m glad you have a friend to do that with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is something I say to friends all the time: “X is saving my life right now!” These says it’s in-person school for the two older kids, living close to my parents so we can walk over as an “outing”, and my new reading chair haha. It’s been inspiring me to read more often because I just want to cozy up in it every night!]]></description>
