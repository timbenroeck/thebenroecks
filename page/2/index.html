				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I haven&#8217;t been creating much online (or on social media) the past few weeks because I&#8217;ve been creating different types of things in &#8216;real&#8217; life: Cookies, decorations, memories, essays, gift lists, to-do lists, really just lots of lists&#8230; and it&#8217;s actually been really good!</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even realize I was taking a hiatus until I saw my last Instagram post (until very recently) was Thanksgiving. Time flies, is what they tell us over and over again. It&#8217;s true.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Currently I&#8217;m sitting at my kitchen table, drinking a hemp milk latte, and listening to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXb7KOnsvmh8V">&#8216;Christmas Coffeehouse&#8217;</a> playlist. Or at least I&#8217;m trying to hear the festive music over Phoebe&#8217;s happy yelling. She&#8217;s playing with the <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bp3Wr">Do-A-Dot paints</a> and is VERY excited about it. The older girls are out with Tim picking up stamps and envelopes for the Christmas cards that have <em>finally</em> arrived. It&#8217;s a (relatively) peaceful little morning around here (for now)!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend you&#8217;re over here drinking a coffee with me while our kids play together, shall we? <strong>Those were the good old days!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8505" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/december-coffee-date.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/december-coffee-date.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/december-coffee-date-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/december-coffee-date-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h1>If we were on a coffee playdate&#8230;</h1>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d tell you that every year I&#8217;m surprised by how many addresses need to be updated for Christmas cards.</strong> Everyone I know moves every single year, apparently. Or if they haven&#8217;t moved that year, I can&#8217;t remember what year they <em>did</em> move so I basically have to contact everyone in my address book every single year to find out where the heck they live. This is going to be a thing for the rest of my life, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d admit that sending Christmas cards is one of my favorite parts of the holiday season.</strong> And (of course!) I love receiving them, too! It gives me an excuse to think a little bit extra about all of our loved ones plus I love seeing all of the family pictures!</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d say that homeschool took a pause in November.</strong> For maybe the entire month. But, now we&#8217;re back into it! Kind of! Some weeks I&#8217;m focusing on it and I&#8217;m completely letting it go for other weeks when I have too much other stuff going on or if the kids seem disinterested. I did buy Isabelle her own <a href="https://www.masterbooks.com/math-lessons-for-a-living-education-level-k">math workbook, </a>though, and she LOVES IT.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d inquire about your Thanksgiving.</strong> We spent a quiet day at home. Usually we spend the holiday with friends in Oregon, so it was a bit sad this year to not be able to do that. Instead, we went on a local hike and made a small dinner at home. I let the girls pick the dishes they wanted us to make and they must have been listening to a Thanksgiving-themed podcast because they picked out <em>all</em> traditional Thanksgiving side dishes. It was great, but the girls don&#8217;t eat Thanksgiving food so I&#8217;m not sure whey they decided mashed potatoes, cranberries and pumpkin pie were the way to go. I, however, loved it all. (I picked biscuits for my side! Delicious.)</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d ask you what you&#8217;ve been reading lately. </strong>I&#8217;m currently reading &#8216;<a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bp32N">Dirt</a>&#8216;. Three good books I&#8217;ve read lately are &#8216;<a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bp31u">Men We Reaped</a>&#8216;, &#8216;<a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bp32T">Transcendent Kingdom</a>&#8216;, and &#8216;<a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bp31z">Lonesome Dove</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d be interrupted mid-sentence every 30 seconds to tell Phoebe to &#8220;GET THAT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!&#8221;</strong> This blog post is taking me 19 years to write because Phoebe has gone from the paint, to markers (not drawing with them, just taking all of the caps off and leaving them strewn around the house), to now playdough. Toddlers are exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>+ Speaking of which, it has just occurred to me that next year I&#8217;ll have <em>only </em>a toddler at home, since both girls will be at school. </strong>I&#8217;ve never had *just* a 2.5 year old at home! What do I do with her?! I guess we&#8217;ll be frequenting parks, the zoo, and possibly any and all toddler classes. (Please Lord let all of the things be open next fall!)</p>
<p><strong>+ I would say that the end of the year and the beginning of a new year are my FAVORITE TIMES. </strong>Give me all of the lists of favorites. Of the bests. Of the worsts. I click on every single &#8216;year in pictures&#8217; link there is. I will listen to all of the podcasts. There is nothing I love more than a good list, especially a year-end list. Expect me to write a few, although if last year is any indication, some will come out in like&#8230; July.</p>
<p>There is not enough time to catch up on ALL OF THE THINGS, but at least we tried before you had to rush home for lunch and naptime!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">In the words of the ladies of Pantsuit Politics (my fav political podcast), I hope you have the best holiday season available to you!</h2>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Along with many other families, we unexpectedly got thrown into homeschooling this year!</p>
<p>The decision was pretty easy for me, as I had (and have!) no interest in doing a hybrid or virtual approach, and I didn&#8217;t want my kids going back in person full-time&#8230; basically school wasn&#8217;t happening for us this year &#8211; so homeschool was the only option for us! (I did feel torn because I didn&#8217;t want our public school to lose funding when we withdrew, but I didn&#8217;t see any way around that.)</p>
<p><strong>At first I was going to opt out of school altogether.</strong> I have a preschooler and a kindergartener, do they really need school?! No, probably not. <em>However,</em> my kids love more structured learning (in small doses) and Clara is an older kindergartner, so I want her to be confident in her knowledge going into first grade next year. Plus, I was pretty excited about the opportunity to teach them at home for a year!</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, I decided to commit to doing some sort of homeschool for the 2020-2021 school year and wanted to share what materials we&#8217;re utilizing in case you need some additional resources / inspiration!</p>

<h1>Homeschool Resources for Kindergarten &amp; First Grade</h1>
<p><strong>+ Overall Approach:</strong> Charlotte Mason via <a href="https://www.amblesideonline.org/01bks">AmblesideOnline</a></p>
<p><strong>+ Math:</strong> <a href="https://www.masterbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lessons For A Living Education</a></p>
<p><strong>+ Language Arts:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodandbeautiful.com/">The Good and the Beautiful</a> (the content for the younger grades is free via PDF format, but I opted to purchase the bundle for Level 1 instead of printing it myself)</p>
<p><strong>+ Handwriting:</strong> <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/bm6nu">Handwriting Without Tears</a></p>
<p><strong>+ Foreign Language (Spanish):</strong> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/salsa/">PBS &#8211; Salsa</a></p>
<p><strong>+ Devotional: </strong><a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boV7h" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leading Little Ones To God</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing a lot of reading from the books recommended through AmblesideOnline for both curriculum and free reading. We also read books suggested by <a href="https://readaloudrevival.com/">Read-Aloud Revival.</a></p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned is that there is sooooo much content and resources out there! I did purchase the workbooks, but AmblesideOnline is free, and we get most of our books from the library.</p>
<p>I also want to mention that we were lucky enough to have the option to send the girls to a fully outdoor school for two days a week, so they&#8217;re attending that. I feel like we have the perfect balance of homeschool, nature time, and socialization. <em>Phew!</em> Every once in a while (and this is one of those times!) I hit a spot in parenthood where I truly feel like I&#8217;m doing what is absolutely best for my family, and it feels like sweet, sweet relief!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How is school going for your little ones this fall?! Let me know if there are any resources out there I should know about!</h2>

				<p>Once the weather started to get a little colder here in the PNW, I started to panic just a bit. Colder weather in Seattle means there is snow falling in the mountains, which means hiking season is coming to an end. (Although we do hike year round, just on more local hikes!) It also means that we&#8217;re about to spend more time at home and indoors &#8211; especially in these pandemic times. I am the <em>opposite</em> of a homebody, so this idea doesn&#8217;t necessarily fill me with excitement.</p>
<p>But, I decided to embrace the season instead of fight it, and to do that, I determined that I needed to gear up on all the things to ensure I could live my best and coziest life.</p>

<h1>Here are the things keeping me cozy:</h1>
<p>+ <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boB6O">These joggers</a> (especially good for us short people! I&#8217;m 5&#8217;2&#8243;).</p>
<p>+ <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boB6Z">This sweatshirt</a> which I may just wear every single day from now on. (It&#8217;s currently on sale at Anthro!)</p>
<p>+ All of the fall candles. Just any of them. Although I personally love <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boB7K">this one</a> for fall/winter.</p>
<p>+ This <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boB9c">wool blanket</a> (for outdoors or indoors, but I mainly bought it for outdoors). I&#8217;ve used this a bunch of times over the past month and it keeps me cozy! Tim doesn&#8217;t like it as an indoor blanket because this particular one is not soft, but I use it for outdoor hangouts and it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>+ <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boB9K">Wool socks.</a> I wear these with my Birkenstocks, because I am a true Pacific Northwesterner now. If living here has taught me one thing, it&#8217;s the importance of wearing wool underlayers! If my feet are warm, the rest of me will stay warm. This is in sharp contrast to my life in Chicago in my early 20&#8217;s when I hobbled around snow drifts in high heels all winter. Live and learn, self.</p>
<p>+ <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boCaV">This tea.</a> It&#8217;s my all-the-time favorite, but especially cozy in colder weather months. Just make sure you get the decaf version if you plan to drink it at night. I thought I had insomnia for A YEAR because I Tim had unintentionally bought the caffeinated version and we kept re-ordering it&#8230; just take it from me that it was a disaster.</p>
<p>+ Lamps. I started turning off our overhead lights and using lamps instead. I love the atmosphere it creates!</p>
<p>+ <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boCbL">This weighted blanket</a>. I love our weighted blanket and it is especially nice for our sensory-seeking kids as well!</p>
<p>+ My <a href="https://shopstyle.it/l/boCcI">Kindle</a>. I read every single night before bed with dim lighting, a candle nearby, a blanket over my legs, a mug of tea in my hand, and a Spotify playlist in the background. It&#8217;s been the best way to end these fall days, especially if I can hear the rain falling on our roof! I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606">Libby app</a> to download books from the library onto my Kindle. Here&#8217;s my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39388910-lisa">Goodreads account</a> if you want to see what I&#8217;ve been reading.</p>
<p>+ Speaking of Spotify, I&#8217;m loving <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWUNIrSzKgQbP">this playlist</a> lately, but there are so many good and moody fall playlists out there!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">I hope you&#8217;re fall is off to the coziest start possible!</h2>

				<p>Let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re on a coffee date, shall we? IN PERSON! I know, I know, crazy thought &#8211; but this is the internet + imagination and we can do what we want. <em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.ashtenomalley.com/blog/2020/9/8/coffee-date-vol-10">Ashten</a> for posting her own coffee date post a while ago, reminding me how much I like them!)</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8486" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffe-date-october.png" alt="" width="850" height="607" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffe-date-october.png 850w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffe-date-october-300x214.png 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffe-date-october-768x548.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<h1>If we were on a coffee date&#8230;</h1>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d tell you that I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a week into October. </strong>OCTOBER! The last quarter of the year! I love September (generally) but this year it was ruined because of smoke. And October&#8230; all of the emojis with heart eyes. It&#8217;s just the best. And arguably the last good month of weather in the PNW until the late spring.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d talk about homeschooling and how well it&#8217;s going.</strong> I truly love it. Granted, I&#8217;m only homeschooling preschool and kindergarten for my older two girls, but it&#8217;s just so fun and the flexibility really fits in with my general life perspective and lack-of-scheduling. I&#8217;ll do another mini-post about homeschool&#8230; maybe. (Lisa, if you read this post in the future, this is a reminder to write the dang post!)</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d ask you what your plans are for this fall.</strong> I, for one, have zero plans. I mean&#8230; maybe we&#8217;ll go to a pumpkin patch? If we don&#8217;t have anything else to do, maybe we&#8217;ll go several times. (HA!) Other than that, I plan on watching football and going on a few hikes and spending time outside as much as possible&#8230; but no big plans over here &#8211; yet!</p>
<p><strong>+ Speaking of football, I&#8217;d ask what you think of the &#8216;fake&#8217; crowd noise they play during the games.</strong> Surprisingly, I like it! I mean, it&#8217;s a little weird, but a completely silent stadium would be way weirder.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d say that we went camping last weekend and we had a blast.</strong> We bought a travel trailer a few months ago and I love it way more than I thought I would. This past weekend we went to <a href="https://parks.state.wa.us/472/Battle-Ground-Lake">Battle Ground Lake State Park</a>. The campground / park was so much fun that we didn&#8217;t even leave for 3 days! We played in the lake. We paddleboarded. We roasted s&#8217;mores. We ate a lot. We rode bikes on trails and roads. It was as relaxing as a camping trip with kids can be! We went with friends, and it was nice to just hang out in a &#8216;normal&#8217; way for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d roll my eyes thinking about how awful those few weeks of smoke were for us on the west coast &#8211; acknowledging that we didn&#8217;t even have the worst of it up here in Seattle!</strong> I&#8217;d probably end up on a tangent about climate change, but mainly I&#8217;d share that I don&#8217;t think moms in other parts of the country understand what it&#8217;s been like on the west coast &#8211; where we&#8217;ve been largely shut down because of Covid, and then were also trapped inside our houses for weeks because of wildfire smoke. It is a new level of anxiety to not be able to breathe the air in your neighborhood, and a lot of my mom-friends have shared that they were on the brink of losing their freakin&#8217; minds &amp; sanity with everything going on. September was HARD.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d perk up when sharing that Phoebe is 18 months old and just the cutest and sweetest little nugget&#8230; still!</strong> I&#8217;m loving the time I get to spend with her lately. The girls + Tim went on a backpacking trip a few weekends ago and Phoebe and I were on our own back at the house, which I loved! I realized that big kids make WAY bigger messes than toddlers (at least at my house) and that toddlers are pretty boring one-on-one. How many times can I read the same book over and over without going crazy was pretty much the game we played for days on end.</p>
<p><strong>+ I&#8217;d acknowledge that although I do truly love our life&#8217;s rhythm/routine right now, I miss having a bit more margin in my life to get some &#8216;extra&#8217; things done.</strong> Like write blog posts! Edit pictures! Print photos for picture frames! Create Phoebe&#8217;s one-year book! All of the things. I work part-time and have the kids full time, and with the activities thrown in (homeschool, gymnastics, outdoor school), I am BUSY like never before. There is nonstop action in our house and my to-do list only gets longer. I&#8217;m going back to bullet journaling for the first time since March, which I think will help.</p>

				<p>Earlier this summer we finally made it down to the Oregon Coast, and it was everything I expected and more. The last time Tim and I had been to the coast was in 2015 when Clara was an itty-bitty baby.  <em>Ah, such fond memories.</em> That trip is actually what convinced us to move to the PNW &#8211; but I digress. The point is, I couldn&#8217;t wait to return to the Oregon Coast, and it turns out exploring the Oregon Coast with kids was even more fun than when it was just Tim and I + a baby.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8482" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oregon-coast-with-kids.png" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="1200" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oregon-coast-with-kids.png 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oregon-coast-with-kids-200x300.png 200w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oregon-coast-with-kids-768x1152.png 768w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oregon-coast-with-kids-683x1024.png 683w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h1><strong>Here&#8217;s What We Did:</strong></h1>
<p>+ Stayed near the beach in <strong>Manzanita</strong>. We used Airbnb to find a rental (use my <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/lisab384?currency=USD">referral code</a> for $35 off your first trip!) and were not disappointed. We found Manzanita to be a more affordable area to stay in than Cannon Beach. However, I think if you&#8217;re willing to stay a bit outside a town, you can find even cheaper places to stay. Especially since we went during a time of social distancing, it wasn&#8217;t necessary for us to be near any restaurants!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8477" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7711.jpg" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7711.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7711-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7711-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>+ Enjoyed the wiiiiiide open beaches near Manzanita. There is so much <em>space </em>on the Oregon Coast and it was really easy to &#8216;socially distance&#8217; ourselves from others.</p>
<p>+ Took pictures near <strong>Cannon Beach</strong> &#8211; because how could we not stop there on our way down?! It is a breathtaking place. One of my favorite memories of the entire trip was watching the girls run into the water near Haystack Rock.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8480" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_7671.jpg" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_7671.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_7671-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_7671-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>+ Hiked to <strong><a href="https://www.theoutbound.com/oregon/hiking/hike-to-short-sands-beach">Short Sands Beach</a></strong> (in Oswald West State Park). The girls were able to do this easily and we shared the trail with a lot of surfers carrying their boards &#8211; which was fun! The hike itself isn&#8217;t anything too special, but the beach was <em>wonderful</em>. We watched surfers, we played in the sand, we saw a waterfall and played on rocks (during low tide)&#8230; it was everything we could want in a beach! Getting there was also super-easy as it is right off highway 101 and only minutes away from Manzanita.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8478" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7707.jpg" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7707.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7707-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7707-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>+ Played in the sand at <strong>Cape Kiwanda</strong>. It was an overcast day when we went to Cape Kiwanda, and honestly we ended up there because our original destinations were all closed because of Covid! However, we did love the beach and the haystack rocks that were there. <em>Fun fact:</em> one is actually taller than the rock at Cannon Beach, but it doesn&#8217;t look that way because it&#8217;s so much further from shore. If the girls were a little older (or maybe if the day was clearer) we would have climbed the dunes. We ordered lunch nearby at <strong><a href="https://www.benandjeffs.com/">Ben &amp; Jeff&#8217;s Burgers and Tacos </a></strong>and ate on the beach, which was fun!</p>
<p>+ Hiked <a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/united-states/oregon/cape-falcon-hike"><strong>Cape Falcon</strong></a> (in Oswald West State Park). Tim and I did this 5-mile hike as a day date. It was an easy hike and the views were wonderful, especially since we went on a sunny day! The parking lot is the same you can park in to get to Short Sands Beach and the hike actually overlooks the beach at a lot of viewpoints. It was neat to see the beach from up above!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8475" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200625-oregon-coast-IMG_7783.jpg" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200625-oregon-coast-IMG_7783.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200625-oregon-coast-IMG_7783-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200625-oregon-coast-IMG_7783-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>+ Ate pizza from <a href="http://marzanospizzapie.com/"><strong>Marzano&#8217;s</strong> <strong>Pizza </strong></a>in Manzanita. We brought most of our food to the trip because 1) we wanted to avoid eating at restaurants and interacting with too many people and 2) we have kids so #1 applies whether we are in a pandemic or not! But we did order pizza one night and it was delicious and fun to eat on the beach! (Or, it should have been fun. Really, it was chaos because it was windy and the kids were too cold (even though I told them to wear pants and not shorts!) and the sand was everywhere&#8230; I mean, if it was just adults, eating on the beach would have been fun! I still recommend trying the experience). While we were in Manzanita (in June) most things were closed during the week, I&#8217;m assuming because of the pandemic, so if you&#8217;re traveling there in the next few weeks/months, maybe be prepared to make your own food.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8479" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7703.jpg" alt="Visiting the Oregon Coast With Kids" width="800" height="533" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7703.jpg 800w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7703-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200624-oregon-coast-IMG_7703-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>+ Drank coffee from <strong>Manzanita Coffee Co.</strong> It was delicious, and they had a lot of bagel options, too! Full disclosure: I wanted to try <strong>Bread and Ocean</strong> (the reviews are great!) but it was closed during our trip. When we go back I&#8217;m going to get coffee from all of theplaces &#8211; for some reason, coffee in Oregon just tastes better.<em> (Shhhh don&#8217;t tell Seattle I said that!)</em></p>
<p>There are so many places to explore on the Oregon Coast, I highly suggest a trip down there! I may make it an annual tradition for us! I wish we could have gone further south, but the 4 hour car ride was long enough for my crew this year. <strong>There&#8217;s always next time!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I know I shouldn&#8217;t have to say this, but if you&#8217;re traveling during the pandemic, be responsible and follow the local guidelines so you can limit exposure to yourself and others. I think it&#8217;s really easy to visit the beach and not interact with others at all, but be prepared for more closures than normal, potentially even of state parks. It&#8217;s best to check the <a href="https://stateparks.oregon.gov/">Oregon State Parks</a> website ahead of time to avoid any frustrations. I didn&#8217;t check the website and we drove for quite a few minutes out of the way only to find a closed park.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Happy Adventuring!</h2>
